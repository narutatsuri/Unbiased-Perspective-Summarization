His expression was a quintessential example of on-the-job 'government speech' that, according to Garcetti, falls outside the First Amendment.\nTo reach his conclusion, Gorsuch simply rewrote the facts. In his account, Kennedy had been suspended exclusively for his silent prayernot the spectacle he created by hijacking football games with prayer circles. And because this prayer was allegedly so 'quiet,  it qualified as 'private' expression shielded by the First Amendment.\nThe coach's prayer, Gorsuch insisted, was 'not delivered as an address to the team, but instead in his capacity as a private citizen.  So even though he was in the middle of a field that he could only access because he was performing his job responsibilities, his speech bore no imprint of government approval, and was totally unconnected to his work as a coach.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, declared: 'Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse Republic---whether those expressions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether they manifest through the spoken word or a bowed head. .\nIn doing so, Sotomayor wrote, the court 'elevates one individual's interest in personal religious exercise, in the exact time and place of that individual's choosing, over society's interest in protecting the separation between church and state, eroding the protections for religious liberty for all. \nThere is a greater issue that the majority, in their zeal, chose to ignore: the freedom of the students to not pray. I'm sure they would say that this freedom remains, and no one has to pray if they choose not to. But such a perspective is risible. Anyone who has ever played high school sports knows that if your coach is doing something, particularly something religious, and expects you to join, then you had better do it. To stand out and say, 'I am Jewish' or 'I am Muslim' or 'I am an atheist'or even simply 'I don't want to do that'is to be labeled a distraction, a locker-room cancer, or worse.\nIt's not just about limiting your time on the field. It's also about making you an outcast among your teammates, a prospect in your teen years about as painful and harmful as not being able to play a sport you love. It's easier to just take a knee for a minute rather than reap the whirlwind of anger from your coach. That is why this is not about freedom but coercion."

'More and more young boys lack male influence altogether. If you want to raise a generation of men who will treat women well, act as protectors rather than victimizers, and become the bedrock for a stable society, you need more masculinity, not less.\nThe social change Gillette and progressive activists want, it turns out, is a return to the moral and social values the conservative movement has been shouting from the rooftops for decades.

Environmental groups have broadened their missions in recent years to address a range of social problems, including racial and economic issues, in part as an effort to build broader coalitions to support their campaigns to fight climate change and pollution.\n'For the climate movement, which for years have said the words 'just transition,  this is the moment where they're actually putting their words into action,  Center for American Progress senior fellow Mike Williams said. 'You can't have a just transition if you don't have good jobs on the other side of it. \n\nRight:\nThis is pitting two parts of the traditional Democratic coalition against each other---the environmentalists against the blue-collar workers, or simply the greens against the blues.\nFain has refused to endorse President Biden for another term because of the president's insistence on following California's lead and ending sales of new internal-combustion-engine vehicles by 2035. The blue-collar workers want their jobs, but the greens care more about trees.\nFord Motor Company president Bob Farley estimates that the industry will need 40 percent fewer workers to produce EVs rather than gas-powered cars and light trucks. That's 200, 000 fewer jobs in 2030 and 400, 000 fewer jobs in the long run. Electrification is leading not only to shrinking worker incomes but to a fundamental fracturing of the Democratic Party coalition. That might be the most damaging part of the UAW strike.\nOne thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won. Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union's pressure. The question is just how much of an increase.\nThe Detroit companies' labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn't unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain's initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.\nGeneral Motors is losing money on every electric vehicle, a situation that it hopes to change by 2025, though the path is far from certain. Ford's EV line is expected to lose $4. 5 billion this year, up nearly 50 percent over last year. Ford's Model E segment is losing $66, 000 on every EV they sell, while competing firm Rivian is losing just under $32, 000 per unit sold. By the time gas-powered bans and EV mandates go into effect, the Big Three will likely still be losing billions of dollars.\nThe Big Three already pay nearly 20 percent higher labor costs than nonunionized foreign automakers with plants in the United States, and nearly 45 percent higher costs than Tesla. If the United Auto Workers succeeds in getting its way, it's possible that the Big Three may shrink to the point of irrelevance, if not fade into the sunset altogether.",
        "document": "When the financial crisis of 2007-9 jeopardized the automakers, the union agreed to give up its annual cost-of-living adjustments, which had begun in 1948. It also accepted expanded use of a two-tier wage structure. Today the starting wage is $18. 04 an hour, which is lower than the 2007 starting wage of $19. 60, Fain said. If the starting wage had kept up with inflation it would be around $29 today, he noted.\nMeanwhile the automakers rebounded from the financial crisis and began to make a lot of money---$250 billion from 2013 through 2022. G. M. and Chrysler were prohibited from issuing big dividends or stock buybacks to reward shareholders as a condition of the federal bailouts they received, but soon after the government sold the last of its shares. they resumed big payouts in earnest. They also boosted top executives' pay.\nThe automakers have argued in negotiations that they will need lots of money to make the transition to electric vehicles, but the big payouts to shareholders and executives somewhat undercut them.\nThere's nothing wrong with a business enterprise in financial distress seeking concessions from its workers, as GM and Chrysler did during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Nor is there anything wrong with a union agreeing to such concessions, as the UAW did.\nBut as the Big Three prospered over the following decade and a half, they never seriously considered making autoworkers whole againlet alone cutting them in on the proceeds of the boom period they helped summon into being. Since 2013, profits at the Big Three have risen 92 percent, according to the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute. During that time period, the companies paid out nearly $66 billion in dividends and stock buybacks, $14 billion of that in this year alone.\nEnvironmental groups are lining up on the side of the United Auto Workers against the Big Three.

Remember, most Americans haven't gone to college.\nA sane political party that's been bleeding working-class support to the GOP during the Trump era would have done something closer to the opposite of all that, engineering a way to bribe lower-class voters and sticking better-educated ones with the bill. They could have seized on Mitt Romney's child tax credit as an opportunity for bipartisan compromise, expecting that voters would credit the president's party on balance for its passage. Instead they're saddling Tim Ryan and other vulnerable Dems with indefensible regressive wealth redistribution on an enormous scale.\nIt's important to appreciate that there has never been an executive action of this costly magnitude in peacetime. Not Mr. Obama's immigration amnesties, not his Clean Power Plan, not Mr. Trump's border-wall fund diversion. Nothing comes close to this half-trillion-dollar or more executive coup. Congress authorized none of Mr. Biden's loan relief and appropriated no funds for it.\nCongress authorized none of Mr. Biden's loan relief and appropriated no funds for it. Even Mr. Biden said in December 2020 it was 'pretty questionable' whether he had authority to cancel debt this way.",
        "document": "The White House estimates that people making less than $75, 000 per year will represent 90 percent of its proposed relief. A college education does not guarantee personal wealth, and student-loan debt by definition excludes the truly rich. A Rockefeller doesn't need to take out student loans to pay for college. Most debtors, in fact, had Pell Grants, designed for 'undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need.  Biden's plan is hardly some giveaway to the American elite.\nA 36-year-old today who went straight to college from high school graduated right into the teeth of the Great Recession, when career-starting jobs were incredibly scarce. For many, graduate school felt like a safe harbor and good long-term investment---or so the college recruiters said. But that meant loans for living expenses along with pricey tuition, which can quickly inflate balances to $100, 000 or more.\nThe core argument for debt forgiveness is not that college graduates are more deserving than their degree-less peers. It's that there are enough public resources to help both, and that graduates in the present are worse off than graduates in the past who benefited from more affordable public university tuition and weren't thrown defenseless into an economic catastrophe.\nFor decades now, the government has been shoveling subsidies into colleges and universities, and (with a few exceptions) they have responded by jacking their prices through the roof. Biden can't do this by himself, of course, but it's long since time for the government to start demanding a better deal.\nOne option would be attaching even more stiff regulations to federally subsidized student loanssimply requiring institutions to cut down on fancy amenities, administrative bloat, and so forth. The administration has announced that the Department of Education would 'hold accountable colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis,  but this consists of an annual watch list of college programs with high debt levels, and strongly worded letters to colleges asking for 'institutional improvement plans.  Obviously, this could be stronger.\nThe average student debt load on graduation is more than $30, 000, and the average student debt-to-income ratio is 55 percent. Biden's student debt relief plan is a superb Band-Aid, but it's a Band-Aid. We shouldn't kid ourselves that the student loan solution to funding higher education will last much longer. It's going to collapse, and before it does we should start moving toward a national policy that provides a college education, debt-free, to anyone who wants it."

We might have been better off with Pelosi's last position before the final bill of $2. 4 trillion, rather than the combined spending between the two bills of $3 trillion or more.\nWhat Biden has presented isn't a COVID-19 relief bill. It is a Sen. Bernie Sanders-type wish list of everything conceivable that the left has wanted to spend money on for years. including paid parental leave, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, $400 a week bonus unemployment checks, transit aid, paid leave of $1, 400 a week, some $100 billion for school aid (for schools that have been shut down for almost a year! ), 'health equity' grants, student debt relief and checks for illegal immigrants. 'If the idea here is to create jobs, there is a less expensive and much more effective way to get employers to hire and workers to get back in the labor market. We could completely eliminate for an entire year the 7. 5% payroll taxes paid by every small business and taken out of every worker's paycheck. That would unleash millions of jobs. This would have virtually ZERO administrative and bureaucratic costs. Instead, we now get Phase 7 of debt spending---and Biden wants another trillion-dollar infrastructure bill to follow.\nThe case for another stimulus appears entirely political. The most recent Commerce Department estimate for the third quarter of 2020 has real GDP up at an annualized rate of 33. 1%largely offsetting the record decline in the second quarter. The Atlanta Fed estimates that the economy grew 10. 4% in the fourth quarter, up from its initial forecast of 2. 2%. Household income is higher than it was before the pandemic, retail sales rose from Nov. 1 through Christmas by 2. 4% compared with last year, total household savings are near a record level, the economic harm of the latest wave of infections is far less than the damage from earlier one, and consumption, based on all economic indicators, is set to leap when pent-up demand is unleashed as the vaccine reduces the virus transmission rate.\n\nRight:\nI think at this point in time, the vaccine piece is obviously the most important part. One official said that what the federal government has done so far has been inadequate and they want to 'actually underwrite the resources necessary for a national vaccination program.  To me this is significant not just in terms of financial resources, but it indicates that the Biden Administration will be actually taking some measure of responsibility for the vaccine situation instead of just passing the buck---treating it as a national issue requiring federal funding and some form of a national plan. 'The odd thing about this package, as described, is that while many of its provisions really are just emergency pandemic measures including stuff like the expanded CTC child tax credit, it really feels like it ought to be permanent policy. It's true, of course, that it will help out with pandemic-related hardship. But drastically reducing child poverty ought to be a forever goal, not just a 2021 goal. 'Matthew Yglesias, SubstackDated but relevant: 'The Child Tax Credit currently offers up to $2, 000 a year for families with significant earnings but little or nothing for many poor people. That's because households have to earn at least $2, 500 per year for the credit to be 'refundable,  or for it to count for households that don't have a positive tax liability. An American without any taxable income---say, a single mom with a kid who lives with family but doesn't have a job because of the recession or some other barrier---won't owe any taxes, but because their income falls below that $2, 500 a year threshold, they don't get any benefit. 'Even above $2, 500 per year the credit phases in slowly, at a rate of 15 percent. A parent has to earn at least $11, 833. 33 to qualify for the full refundable credit, a bar that the poorest households can't meet. The Biden proposal would expand the size of the child credit and make it fully available for all poor people regardless of earnings. If passed Poverty among children would fall from 14. 8 percent to 9. 5 percent, meaning 4 million kids would escape poverty. Deep poverty---the share of kids living on half the poverty line or less---would fall almost by half, from 4. 6 percent to 2. 4 percent. 'Dylan Matthews, VoxRegarding the minimum wage increase, 'Republicans have long opposed such a move. The Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, blocked a minimum wage increase in 2019, and Republicans filibustered a minimum wage increase effort in 2014. 'So far the overall plan has, however, united two diametrically opposed forces---Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders and big business. The US Chamber of Commerce, an influential lobbying organization that represents business interests, praised Biden's proposal. 'We applaud the president-elect's focus on vaccinations and on economic sectors and families that continue to suffer as the pandemic rages on,  the group said in a statement.\nThe $1. 9 trillion in relief Biden is proposing is more than double the $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that Democrats passed in 2009 in the wake of the Great Recession. The size and scope of this proposal is a reflection of some lessons Democrats have learned: In 2009, many lawmakers believed they'd have a chance at another bill to deliver more help, but they never did. And so the recovery was slower and more uneven than it could have been had they been more ambitious at the outset.\nOne way to think about the plan is that America's output gapbasically, the economic dent created by the coronavirus crisisis probably somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent at the moment. The $1. 9 trillion would fill that and then some. Biden says he wants to try and pass his initial relief bill with bipartisan support, instead of resorting to the budget reconciliation process that would allow it to be enacted with just a bare majority in the Senate. one can't help but ask: Will Biden ultimately let the GOP shave down the size of this bill in order to win their votes? 'Jordan Weissmann, SlateSome argue that 'Smuggling in the entire Democratic agenda, immediately, in the context of a 'relief' bill, seems like a recipe for disaster. It also confuses the public. Most of these ideas are popular and Republicans should be put in the position of making a judgment on each one of them, one at a time. That begins with the checks legislation, which was a direct campaign promise. People need the help now, the Georgia senators won on it, and my belief and the belief of numerous members of the Senate is that 60 votes exist for it. building some mega-bill gives Republicans an easy out for their opposition.",

'Even above $2, 500 per year the credit phases in slowly, at a rate of 15 percent. A parent has to earn at least $11, 833. 33 to qualify for the full refundable credit, a bar that the poorest households can't meet.

And so the recovery was slower and more uneven than it could have been had they been more ambitious at the outset.\nOne way to think about the plan is that America's output gapbasically, the economic dent created by the coronavirus crisisis probably somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent at the moment. The $1. 9 trillion would fill that and then some. Biden says he wants to try and pass his initial relief bill with bipartisan support, instead of resorting to the budget reconciliation process that would allow it to be enacted with just a bare majority in the Senate. one can't help but ask: Will Biden ultimately let the GOP shave down the size of this bill in order to win their votes? 'Jordan Weissmann, SlateSome argue that 'Smuggling in the entire Democratic agenda, immediately, in the context of a 'relief' bill, seems like a recipe for disaster. It also confuses the public. Most of these ideas are popular and Republicans should be put in the position of making a judgment on each one of them, one at a time. That begins with the checks legislation, which was a direct campaign promise. People need the help now, the Georgia senators won on it, and my belief and the belief of numerous members of the Senate is that 60 votes exist for it. building some mega-bill gives Republicans an easy out for their opposition.\n\nRight:\nThe biggest problem. is his plan to increase the generosity of the direct checks to individuals passed last month from $600 to $2, 000. These checks would be less generous for higher-income people. But many would still go to households with six-figure incomes, and some would even go to families earning more than $300, 000 per year. Moreover, the checks are designed to go to all households with income below a cap, including those that did not experience employment loss. 'The goals of any economic stimulus bill are straightforward: to preserve the productive capacity of the economy, to relieve suffering and to help the economy adapt to post-pandemic changes. How do direct checks advance any of those goals? What pressing needs do the checks fulfill?\nSince the mid-1970s, one-time cash payments to individuals to stimulate economic growth have been tried on at least five separate occasions. But history shows such spending does nothing to stimulate the economy. In the end, it only adds to the federal debt. 'Although data are still coming in on the effects of the one-time cash payments authorized by last March's Cares Act, so far the pattern is the same. Using a large-scale survey of its effects, a National Bureau of Economic Research study by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Michael Weber found that 'most respondents report that they primarily saved or paid down debts with their transfers, with only about 15 percent reporting that they mostly spent it.  Thus the payments have done little to boost the economy. 'Short-run economic assistance to individuals can be justified on humanitarian grounds, not on the discredited idea of stimulating the economy. That means it should be focused on small businesses and individuals who have suffered hardship from government-imposed lockdowns, while public officials keep working to make vaccines and treatments available as quickly as possible.\nRemember when Mitch McConnell bet the Senate majority on refusing to take up the direct-stimulus relief bill from the House? How's that working out? . 'Now, not only will Biden get credit for it if it passes, McConnell can't keep it from coming to floor any more. McConnell might be able to filibuster it, but Democrats are already planning to use reconciliation to force it through if necessary---and plenty of Republicans might not want to start out 2021 by blockading the new administration's emergency aid push, especially after the egregious optics of the past week or so.

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nMcConnell has noticeably aged since his bad fall in March, when he sustained a concussion and broken rib, and he should want, for his own sake and that of his colleagues, to go out on his own terms. The details can be left to McConnell, who deserves a large measure of deference. A leadership transition doesn't need to happen urgently, but the wheels should be turning.\nStepping aside from leadership would not necessarily require leaving the Senate; McConnell could, like Nancy Pelosi, remain in office, and he would doubtless remain influential so long as he is capable of serving. But the job of caucus leader demands more. The time has come for the Kentucky senator, after his long, impressive run, to make the decision to step aside from leadership.\nWe ought to add an upper age limit for president, Congress, and judges in order to head off crises before they happen and hopefully, at the margins, encourage some new blood. It is true that age is an imperfect proxy for the capacity to do the job, but the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are all but self-enforcing in a way that is impersonal and bipartisan.\nRemoving a president or a Supreme Court justice from office on grounds of mental or physical unfitness would instigate a titanic political power struggle; doing so because they'd hit a constitutional age limit would be a routine thing. Many state courts, for example, already have mandatory retirement ages. Adding such limits is likely to save us more grief than it will cost us in the services of wise old heads.\nOthers argue, 'We act as if these septuagenarians and octogenarians have been thrust upon us by some unknown force. We put them there. If three-quarters of voters truly believed President Joe Biden is too old for office, they would find someone else to run. But Democrats would rather pretend that the president. is an intellectual and physical dynamo because they want to hold onto power.\nThe reality is that when it matters, voters across the country love the old-timers---perhaps because they are known quantities or maybe they bring home the money or maybe people genuinely like them.

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Right-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Right '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nPresident Trump has a clear path to 270 electoral votes and he's busy earning each and every one of them. I believe the president will carry Texas, Indiana and all the other reliably red states for his first 163 electoral votes. In 2016, his road to victory ran through Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. In 2020, this path remains intact, with the addition of Georgia and Arizona. With repeat victories in these states, plus the electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional Districts, that brings President Trump's tally to 260 electoral votes---just 10 votes shy of the magic number of 270. 'Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin has 10. In this scenario, with the president sitting at 260 electoral votes, he needs to win just one of these three states to prevail. The president is also on offense and actively campaigning in Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire---states he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016. To put a fine point on it, he only lost these three states by approximately 74, 000 votes combined.\nFlorida went for Trump in '16 by a mere 1. 2 points. He's been trailing in the polls there, but Trump's popularity with Hispanic voters has been surging, so look for Florida to stay---barely---red. Minnesota, meanwhile, went for Clinton in 2016 by less than two points, and a long summer of urban violence in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police may lead to a 2020 law-and-order win here for Trump. The same is true of neighboring Wisconsin, where violence also flared in Kenosha. 'Early voting generally favors the Democrats, but in several states Trump needs to win, including Florida and North Carolina, Republicans are closing the gap. The good news for Trump is that if he can win Nevada and hold on to Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Arizona and Georgia, he can afford to lose Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota and still cross the finish line with at least 275 electoral votes. In the weird year of 2020, that's as good as a landslide. 'Michael Walsh, New York PostIn Florida, 'Democrats need to run up the score in Miami-Dade to have any hope of winning the state's 29 Electoral College votes, and so far the Biden campaign's turnout isn't even keeping up with Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 effort.\nPolling and analytics only take campaigns so far. They have to ask voters to participate, and keep following up, with effective community-based efforts. The RNC and the Trump campaign has used that model throughout the campaign, tracking and targeting voters who might need extra encouragement to get to the polls and (hopefully) calculating their messages in the local context of each community. 'It's far too late to launch an effective GOTV Get-out-the-vote effort now, no matter how much money the Biden campaign pours into the effort. It takes months to build the kind of contacts and networks that will effectively motivate low-propensity voters to the polls. It takes weeks just to identify the people who can even make contact with those voters. Team Biden bet that an air war would win in a pandemic. So far, it looks like they're going to lose, at least in Florida---and the fact that Biden showed up in Minnesota today hints that it's failing even in safer states.\nThe Commerce Department released the U. S. gross domestic product number for the third quarter, showing growth rate of around 33 percent. The economy is turning around, playing to Trump's strength. The president has made significant outreach to minorities, and a relative handful of Black voters switching from Democrat to Republican could help him secure states like Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. Not to mention that Trump---unlike Biden---is actually campaigning for the job. 'Pollsters insist their surveys have been adjusted from 2016 to include more demographics that support Trump---though they may harbor new flaws. They are still unlikely to capture the vast enthusiasm gap between Trump and Biden voters and fail to pick up the 'shy Trump voters, ---people afraid to admit they back Trump---who may be shyer than ever. . 'The shy voter phenomenon could prove even more pronounced in 2020 than in 2016. You could at least explain not voting for Clinton. She was unlikable to so many. Though inspiring fewer strong feelings, Biden is, at least, not as easy to despise. What's more, Trump has been vilified for the past four years, giving voters less of an excuse to admit they're still voting for him. This could be particularly true for Black and Latino voters. 'Keith Koffler, NBC NewsSome caution that 'the final national polls in 2016 were pretty accurate. There were some big misses in state polling (Wisconsin most of all) but national polls on average had Clinton winning by around three points when in reality she won by two. Trump can't win the electoral college if Biden wins the national popular vote this time by, say, seven. it'll take a much bigger polling screw-up this time for Trump to win than it took in 2016.\n\nRight:\nBiden leads in all the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016 by more than 5 points. He is also ahead in a bunch of contests that Trump won in 2016. even if Biden were to win just the states where he led by 5 points or more, he'd still get over the 270 electoral vote mark. More interesting is what happens if you look at the specific state errors that occurred in 2016. The errors were biggest in the Great Lake (Rust Belt) states. They tended to be considerably smaller in the Sun Belt. As The New York Times' Nate Cohn points out, Biden would get more than 300 electoral votes if the 2016 errors repeated themselves exactly in 2020. 'Finally Biden's ahead by 9 to 10 points nationally. Clinton was up by 3 to 4 points in the final polls of 2016 and took the popular vote by 2 points, a small error. Previous calculations indicate Trump probably can't win in the Electoral College if he loses by more than 4 to 5 points nationally. In order to win, Trump would need to benefit from a much bigger polling error than four years ago.\nIn Pennsylvania, Clinton's unfavorable rating was 56 percent, as measured by an October 2016 Quinnipiac survey. This month, the same pollster showed Biden at 43 percent. In Wisconsin, Clinton's unfavorable rating stood at 52 percent in a Marquette survey. Marquette now shows Biden at 45 percent. In comparable surveys, Biden's net favorable rating has beaten Clinton's by 11 points in North Carolina, 13 in Wisconsin, 18 in Florida, 23 in Pennsylvania, and 27 in Georgia. Her average unfavorable rating across the five states was 56 percent. Biden's is 45 percent. That's the difference between winning and losing. 'In fact, these numbers understate the gap. The last voters to make up their minds are independents, and they're way more open to Biden than they were to Clinton. Among independents, in same-pollster comparisons, Biden's net favorable rating has exceeded Clinton's by shocking margins: 30 points in Wisconsin, 32 in Georgia, 38 in North Carolina, 44 in Pennsylvania, and 45 in Florida.\nGeneral election voters still perceive Biden as relatively moderate, and historically, more moderate presidential candidates generally do better in general elections. They generate less opposition when it comes to voter turnout and are perceived as less extreme by swing voters---though that advantage is declining. In fact, Trump benefited from this dynamic in 2016, when he was perceived as more moderate than most Republican candidates. 'Additionally, Biden's supposed lack of enthusiasm among small donors never really materialized. Despite struggling with online donations in the primary, Biden is now raising 1, 000 times as much online per day as he was last year. He's also outraising Trump, which suggests that maybe in fundraising, partisanship matters more than excitement around the nominee or even ideology. Likewise, voter turnout estimates remain very high. it is increasingly looking like Democractic primary voters might have been right about Biden's electability argument.\nTrump's relentless campaigning across the Rust Belt has masked the fact that many of his most powerful advisersincluding Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and his former top economic adviser Gary Cohnare closely aligned with the free-trade ethos of Wall Street. The five hundred thousand pre-coronavirus manufacturing jobs that the Trump Administration is touting, Robert E. Scott, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute noted, is the same relatively small number that were created during the last three years of Obama's term. 'Bernie Porn, the president of EPIC-MRA, one of Michigan's oldest pollsters, told me that a week before the 2016 election 'Clinton was leading among union members by only forty-six to thirty-eight per cent, with eight per cent for third-party candidates and thirteen per cent undecidedmost of which went to Trump.  In EPIC-MRA's most recent poll, Biden is leading among union members, seventy-one to twenty-three per cent. 'Dan Kaufman, New YorkerRegarding voter turnout, 'Texans have already cast more ballots in the 2020 election than they did in 2016. the state's urban and suburban counties have been the primary drivers of the turnout spike, with Harris County (home to Houston) mounting an especially impressive showing. Nearly 1. 4 million people have already cast ballots in Harris, setting a new record for the county. 'In 2018, a 27-year-old Colombian American immigrant named Lina Hidalgo narrowly defeated an 11-year Republican incumbent to become Harris's 'county judge,  its top elective position. In 2016, Harris spent roughly $4 million on administering its elections. Under Hidalgo's leadership, the county pumped that budget up to $31 million: Enough money to triple the number of early voting sites in the county, and keep some locations open 24 hours during the final days of early voting. no matter how the final vote tally shakes out, the existing data already offers Democrats one vital lesson: Obscure local elections can have enormous consequences.",

'It's far too late to launch an effective GOTV Get-out-the-vote effort now, no matter how much money the Biden campaign pours into the effort.

'And who cares if she's an effective legislator? She's facing a Republican Senate and a Republican president. Nothing she passes is getting signed into law over the next two years. Democrats are better off booting her, installing a younger team, and letting them use these next two years as low-stakes on-the-job training in the hope/expectation that they'll have total control of government after 2020.\n\nRight:\nAs Democrats in the House begin the discussion of who should lead them, it is crucial they focus on the fundamental roles of Speaker of the House---to pass legislation and steer the ship through experienced oversight. . . 'As Speaker, Nancy Pelosi brings to the podium a wealth of experience and success. She knows how to pass bills. She knows how to steer a sometime cumbersome ship. She has worked to reach across the aisle when necessary. . . You change leadership when it suffers catastrophic losses, not when you win elections.\nWithout Nancy Pelosi's toughness, focus and legislative skill, there would probably be no Affordable Care Act. Her speakership during the Obama presidency left a legacy of achievement in other areas as well, including a far-reaching reform of Wall Street regulation and a massive economic stimulus that helped save a collapsing economy. Furthermore It would be hard to find a more effective fundraiser for Democrats, and she just led her party to its largest House gains since 1974. . . 'Oh, yes, and there is no obvious alternative to her leadership. \nThe anti-Pelosi movement is a mashup of opportunism on the part of a few wannabe leaders, such as Moulton and Ryan, combined with a dose of ageism, sexism and defensive tactical moves by a few Democrats who won in conservative districts. \nMany point out that 'these talking points about 'fresh blood' and accusations that Pelosi is a 'centrist' seem to have convinced a number of progressive voters that ousting Pelosi and replacing her with someone new is about pulling the party to the left. . . Except not only has Pelosi consistently been in the top third of most liberal Democrats in the House. . . but the much-ballyhooed insurgency against her among House Democrats almost exclusively consists people who are to Pelosi's right. . . 'Moreover the person from that group who's being floated as a potential replacement for Pelosi, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, is openly hostile to LGBTQ rights. . . Ousting Pelosi would be a blow to ordinary women and LGBTQ people whose concerns will lose priority status if the anti-Pelosi wing prevails.\nSome, however, say, 'Go ahead, Democrats. Fight over Nancy Pelosi. Just get it out of your systems now, please. . . Members old and new need to air their grievances, hash out their differences and set a course for how the team can better function over the next two sure-to-be-bonkers years. . . Better to have as many of these fights as possible before the new Congress convenes in January. At that point, the caucus will need to get focused and pull together for the real fights to come.",

Studies are still outstanding. What we do know is there are people and doctors who do believe that their patients saw the benefit. 'Why are public health officials in the media dismissing ivermectin and ridiculing people who take it? Not the horse dosage, but the doctors who say, hey, there are a lot of people out there who think this works. You've got a case of COVID. Let's get this in your system and see if it helps. Why are we ridiculing those people when they're trying to help their patients who may not be vaccinated? . If ivermectin has a shot at helping people turn the corner, why not give it to them?\n\nRight:\nDespite its surging popularity, there's no good evidence that ivermectin is effective against the coronavirus. The largest and most reputable clinical trial to date found the drug offered no clinical benefit whatsoever, and much of what's been sold as promising evidence to the contrary has been debunked. Meanwhile, increasing reports of emergency room visits, poison control calls, and significant side effects associated with off-label ivermectin uselargely among patients unwilling to get vaccinated against Covid-19, even as hospitalizations and deaths climbhave become downright alarming.\nThe pro-ivermectin crowd would have you believe that the science on ivermectin is being 'suppressed.  It is not. Some of the largest scale scientific efforts ever have involved the study of ivermectin in Covid-19. Another claim is that the pharmaceutical industry does not want to lose potential profits to a relatively cheap, older drug. This claim conveniently ignores the fact that one of the only drugs with good evidence for use in Covid-19 is dexamethasone, a cheap, old drug that has been implemented worldwide during this pandemic. 'Groups of contrarian physicians have emerged to promote 'cures' without adding any evidence, and despite names like 'America's Front Line Doctors' and 'Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance,  their members often do not work clinically---meaning they do not actually have credentials to practice medicine in any hospital settings---and do not treat Covid-19 patients.\nThese fringe groups of contrarian physicians are small and have damning track records. America's Front Line Doctors is reported to be involved in fraudulent business practices involving charging people and failing to deliver on prescriptions and consultations. And the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology dropped a study by the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance after it was discovered that the authors made unsubstantiated claims. 'So why are these groups trusted? They have unique credibility with hard-core right-wingers and anti-vaxxers. The founder of America's Front Line Doctors entered the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6. And the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance has gotten support from anti-vaccination activists online and in the podcast world. This matters because it suggests that vulgar hostility to science isn't the only culprit in communities resistant to the vaccines. 'There's a desire, even among those on the fringe of mainstream beliefs about medicine, for technical information, insider knowledge and some kind of expertise. the desire to opt out of mainstream public health norms doesn't mean that everyone opposed to the vaccines fails to appreciate the dangers of Covid-19. It means that there's a search for an alternative solution to the government-backed vaccines which requires turning to sources who have perceived ideological credibility. This has substantial implications for how we go about trying to persuade those resisting the vaccines.\nEarlier this week, Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky. ), who is an ophthalmologist, argued that 'hatred for Trump' was hindering ivermectin research. Actually, Sen. Paul is who's hindering ivermectin research: He voted against the March stimulus bill that included funding for the NIH ACTIV-6 trial, which is studying ivermectin. And the researchers I spoke to last week were worried about exactly the opposite dynamic: At this point, many Americans are just taking ivermectin instead of enrolling in trials for potential COVID treatments.",
        "document": "Snarking that Joe Rogan is taking a 'horse dewormer' for his coronavirus infection may well be (and probably is) inaccurate. In its haste to goof on Rogan for having flirted with anti-vaxxism in the past, the press is being irresponsible. And they should be called on it. But the bigger story is that seemingly many thousands of Americans are hunting around for a drug which at least 14 different studies have shown doesn't work on COVID. 'Some meaningful number of our fellow citizens are either so allergic to medical consensus or so dug in on their antipathy to the vaccines that they're willing to dose themselves with an unproven drug in the expectation that they'll eventually own the smarmy pro-vax eggheads when ivermectin ends up curing their COVID. It's true that taking normal doses of the drug won't harm a person, but that's not the point. What'll harm them is encouraging or enabling their foolish decision to rely on an unproven prophylactic/treatment in lieu of getting the vaccine.\nWe have three approved vaccines in use in the US, plus we have monoclonal antibody treatments available---which Rogan is also employing to deal with his acute infection. One could understand individuals and a few doctors experimenting with treatments when we had no tested and effective treatments available to deal with an explosive pandemic. That's no longer the case, and we should be emphasizing the use of what we know works rather than take flyers on medicines that haven't been demonstrated effective against any viruses, let alone COVID-19 in particular. 'In other words---get vaccinated. If you get a breakthrough infection anyway, get monoclonal antibody treatment as soon as possible. Stick to what we already know is effective. That's the responsible approach to personal health in this pandemic. 'Ed Morrissey, Hot AirOthers argue, 'we do not know whether ivermectin is an effective treatment against COVID-19. Because it's not an anti-viral treatment, it's very likely that it's not effective at all. But there is also no evidence that ivermectin would harm coronavirus patients if it is prescribed in the correct dosage. So why shouldn't patients be able to request the drug for treatment if they want?\nWe do know that ivermectin can cause your body to produce a strong immune response even though it's for parasites like worms and the like. But A great many people in the medical community, epidemiologists, virologists, and others believe that ivermectin itself is not actually helping. That to the extent people feel benefited from it, they're getting either the placebo effect or their body was on the verge of turning the corner anyway because they had a mild case. 'So now let's take the next step. Is it the placebo effect? Maybe. Is it people who are going to turn the corner anyway? Maybe. Is it ivermectin actually did something? Maybe. Studies are still outstanding. What we do know is there are people and doctors who do believe that their patients saw the benefit. 'Why are public health officials in the media dismissing ivermectin and ridiculing people who take it? Not the horse dosage, but the doctors who say, hey, there are a lot of people out there who think this works. You've got a case of COVID. Let's get this in your system and see if it helps. Why are we ridiculing those people when they're trying to help their patients who may not be vaccinated? . If ivermectin has a shot at helping people turn the corner, why not give it to them?"

But the gaps exist because of Mr. Trump's obstruction, a stonewall that the House probably could not have overcome without months of court proceedings that, during an election year, could have made impeachment a practical impossibility. Mr. Trump has said he will invoke executive privilege to curtail testimony by Mr. Bolton and others. That should only incentivize senators: If the president had nothing to fear from truthful testimony, he would not go to such lengths. 'Mr. Bolton has said he would testify if the Senate calls him, and he has a book forthcoming. Could it be that the Senate will refuse to hear a firsthand account that could soon be in the public domain?\nMr. Trump has never asserted any particularized reasons for preventing administration officials from cooperating with the impeachment investigation (beyond deeming it a 'sham' and a 'hoax' impeachment, which is not a legal argument but a political one). So, his claims are the epitome of 'generalized assertions'---which are not sufficient to trigger the application of executive privilege. 'Chief Justice Warren Burger, in United States v. Nixon, a major precedent decided in 1974 during the height of the Watergate investigation, found that the president does enjoy a constitutional privilege to protect confidences within the executive branch. At the same time, however, he emphatically rejected President Richard Nixon's claims then, like President Trump's claims now, that executive privilege is self-defined and potentially unlimited in scope. Chief Justice Burger explained that when the president's assertion of executive privilege 'is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. \nThe choice of House managers underscores the Democrats' effort to press Senate Republicans to treat this is a real trial, as mandated by the Constitution. The group includes six attorneys and one former police chief; all are people familiar with court proceedings and criminal activities. 'Despite Trump's determined effort to block the release of any of the documents requested by investigators, Americans were slapped with a new batch of material showing Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and another Trump supporter at work on the Ukraine scheme. As the Senate trial prepares to start, Americans of all parties should ponder, is this what they want from their president? Pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political rival; having US diplomats tracked and intimidated? Allowing oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to fund operations aimed at boosting his reelection chances?\nGiuliani's letter states that he was explicitly working in his capacity as Trump's personal attorney, undercutting the president's claim that the effort was in the country's interest because it was aimed at rooting out corruption. It also contradicts Trump's claim that Giuliani may have been working for other clients or for himself in Ukraine. The letter came one day after Giuliani told The New York Times that he planned to travel to Ukraine to find damaging information on Biden, which could help Trump's re-election campaign.\nTuesday's new evidence won't fundamentally change either side's approach in the upcoming trial. Parnas did not directly communicate with the president himself, making its relevance to his impeachment somewhat limited. What the revelations do underscore is how little Americans actually know about one of the worst political scandals in the nation's historyand the fierce urgency of shedding light on it. 'One need not be a conspiracy theorist to know that there's more to uncover here. Top aides like Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton haven't testified. The White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon haven't turned over any records about the plot to pressure Zelenskiy or hold up congressionally allocated military aid for Ukraine. Trump's impeachment trial may not hinge on this information. But it's still vital to uncover it so Americans can definitively answer the most important question about the Ukraine scandal: What happened?\n\nRight:\nOne of the two lead prosecutors would be kicked out of any normal court for repeated lies. Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the world for years in his nonstop campaign to smear President Trump. Back in March 2017, he insisted that he'd seen 'more than circumstantial evidence' that Trump had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election---a claim exposed as false by the Mueller report. Months later, he insisted that Rep. Duncan Nunes was flat-out wrong to say that the FBI's Russia investigation relied heavily on the absurd Steele Dossier to get warrants to surveil Carter Page; the recent inspector-general report shows that Nunes was right---and Schiff had to know it.\nPelosi should have appointed independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash instead of Schiff. Amash used to be a Republican, so he would at least have the appearance of moderation. Because he is now an independent, the accusation of deliberate partisanship simply would not apply. Amash is also in favor of impeaching Trump, but for constitutional reasons, not political ones. 'I might disagree with Amash's conclusions on impeachment, but I respect the way in which he reached those conclusions. He thought through the allegations, listened to the testimonies, read the evidence, and then made up his mind. Can Schiff say the same?\nHouse Democrats rushed through the investigation, forgoing salient witnesses and evidence, because of the political calendar. The charges are weak and the inquiry was needlessly short-circuited, so Democrats have continued investigating the premature allegations. Now they are publicly disclosing newly acquired evidence, with the promise of more to come. Transparently, their goal is to pressure the Senate not merely to conduct a trial but to complete the investigation that the House failed to complete. 'No trial court would allow itself to be whipsawed this way. A federal judge would tell prosecutors to go back to the grand jury, finish the investigation, and come back to the trial court when they have a case ready to be tried, not investigated. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans should hold the two pending articles in abeyance, or vote to dismiss them without prejudice to the House's revoting them when its impeachment inquiry is finally concluded.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) writes, 'The Senate's role is not to undertake a new inquiry, but rather to conduct a trial based on the articles of impeachment passed by the House and decide whether removing a president from office is warranted. It's also a historical precedent that the initial arguments in a Senate trial be limited to the testimony and evidence gathered by the House. 'During initial presentations, the Senate will only hear arguments from the record---the record the House built. After that initial phase, we can call in additional witnesses as needed. The argument that the Senate should be expanding investigations before initial arguments are even presented is a tacit acknowledgment on the part of some Democrats of what we all know to be true: the House rushed and failed to complete its duty thoroughly, making a mockery of the impeachment process.\nMrs. Pelosi said on the House floor Wednesday that her month delay allowed new 'evidence' to emerge. But if that's true, why did the House rush its votes before the holiday? In any case the new evidence she cites is merely more detail about what we already know. Mr. Trump exhibited poor judgment in unleashing Rudy Giuliani to ask Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. but he broke no law, and other Presidents have tried to use foreign policy to serve domestic political ends. Voters may conclude these are grounds for denying Mr. Trump re-election. But if they are enough to short-circuit a presidential term, then many more Presidents will be impeached. 'At this stage we don't see what good would be done by calling Senate witnesses. If Mr. Bolton is called, then Republicans may call Hunter or Joe Biden or both. This would be a circus, and it would pay too much homage to the flimsy House evidence and rigged process. The Senate may not even need to hear from the President's defense team. Let the House managers make their case. If a majority of Senators believe the evidence is as inadequate as we do, then repudiate this impeachment with votes to acquit on both articles.",

So, his claims are the epitome of 'generalized assertions'---which are not sufficient to trigger the application of executive privilege. 'Chief Justice Warren Burger, in United States v. Nixon, a major precedent decided in 1974 during the height of the Watergate investigation, found that the president does enjoy a constitutional privilege to protect confidences within the executive branch.

It should not require courage to declare that we are a country that knows life is something to be cherished, not something to be tossed on the trash heap.\nIs it cynical it point out that the majority of elected Democrats---including every presidential hopeful in the Senate---are, judging from polling numbers, far to the left of the country? Although polls have consistently shown that large majorities of Americans oppose all third-trimester abortions, I can't find one that asks if they support the practice of aborting infants who had the temerity to survive a third-trimester abortion. I wonder what the numbers would look like on that question.\nDemocrats are helping Trump expand the range of anti-abortion voters---arguably his single most reliable constituency---from religious conservatives to Americans in the broad muddled middle of the most important political debate in this country's history. In the space of only a month, the percentage of Americans who identified themselves as 'pro-choice' dropped by nearly 10. Some 47 percent of Americans call themselves pro-choice; the same percentage say they are pro-life. This has not been the case in a decade.",
        "document": "There are painful situations in which the fetus might be at the edge of viability and labor must be induced to save the mother's life. For instance, a condition called pre-eclampsia, involving high blood pressure and other problems, can kill both mother and fetus, and in most cases the only treatment is to deliver the baby. If it seems unlikely that the baby will survive, the family may choose to provide just comfort care---wrapping and cuddling the baby---and allow the child to die naturally without extreme attempts at resuscitation.\nHaving a child born to die on his or her birthday is a unique tragedy. While some parents may insist on heroic measures, many of us, after counseling from neonatologists, specialists in high-risk pregnancies and other medical professionals decide that a blanket and an embrace is the highest quality care we can give our baby. Politicians who twist the memory of a birth followed by a death to score political points and mislead about the reality of both abortion and newborns who are born to die should be ashamed of themselves.\nLaws already exist to protect the baby. In 2002, Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which guaranteed to infants born at any stage of development full legal rights. That bill, which passed with bipartisan support, did not include criminal penalties for doctors and did not impose specific requirements on medical care.  According to a board member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, this bill 'is a stark departure from the 2002 law as it singles out abortion and applies strict new requirements on abortion providers only, with the intent to malign and threaten abortion providers.\nSasse is capitalizing on a manufactured controversy over a New York bill recently signed into law. In so doing, he mischaracterizes the bill, saying in his press release that it 'repealed protections. for an infant born alive during an abortion.  In reality, New York lawmakers removed abortion from the criminal code, as the state had decided to criminalize the medical procedure before the historic Supreme Court decision in 1973. Lawmakers also created a new section within public health law, solidifying the right to abortion up 24 weeks and access thereafter strictly in cases of fetal non-viability and to preserve the health or life of the pregnant person.\nThe move is part of a larger strategy designed to maintain current abortion restrictions while revving up the GOP's conservative base ahead of 2020 and courting independents who may be turned off by the Democrats' position on abortion rights. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) laments that 'This is pure Mitch McConnell. It's all aimed at keeping his base in line, while the president grows increasingly unpopular. We're not doing infrastructure, we're not doing health care. We're not doing anything that matters to help our country. It's just votes on abortion and other kinds of divisive votes he's going to bring."

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nPros laughed at his use of charts and talk of NAFTA's 'giant sucking sound' taking jobs to Mexico, but he won the very voters who'd later be the core Trump constituency. It's easy to see why: During the '92 campaign, he groused: 'Our president blames Congress, Congress blames the president, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody steps up to the plate and accepts responsibility for anything.  Ross Perot the outsider still has a point. Rest in peace.\nWhen you look closely at Perot's campaigns, you see his influence everywhere ever since. His populist attitude against Washington informed the Gingrich-led Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. His fondness for plain-spoken fiscal rectitude popped up again in Al Gore's Social Security 'lock box' and later in the Tea Party. And of course, Perot now looks like the Morning Star of Trumpism. Like Perot, President Trump is also a billionaire populist and a trade protectionist. Trump appeals to the same secular, nationalist voters that were Perot's base. But Trump also appealed to and made pacts with all the factions of the Republican party. 'Michael Brendan Dougherty, National Review\nPerot's allergy to social conservatives was one of the things that would doom his populism. Trump, like Perot, campaigned as something of a moderate on social issues---but he did so without excluding social conservatives, and since becoming president he has served his coalition allies better than many a professed true-believer conservative Republican ever did. Trump also realized, as Perot should have recognized a quarter-century earlier, that third-party politics was a waste of time, when the same resources could be used to take over the GOP from within.\nFrom the perspective of 2019, H. Ross Perot looks like a key precursor to Trump: the billionaire political outsider who popped up on Larry King Live, opposed free trade deals, and who spoke bluntly and simply and promised to just roll up his sleeves and look under the hood. But there were some key differences. Perot worried about the deficit---'the crazy aunt in the basement' and about the debt---back when it was a 'mere' $5 trillion. He supported means-testing Social Security. His policy interests were not wide but he knew enough about them to give lectures with charts. Perot was feisty but rarely obnoxious. 'Jim Geraghty, National Review\nWhat stood out for me about Perot was his raging moderation. Unlike most angry candidates running a populist campaign, Perot was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, and basically a centrist---more so, anyway than his two opponents (which is why Team Bush was wrong, I think, to claim that Perot cost Bush the election; studies have shown that Perot took about as many votes away from Clinton as he did from Bush). Trump's political genius, or one aspect of it, was his realization that he could capture the Republican presidential nomination and, eventually, the Republican Party. I wonder how Perot would have fared if he had tried to do the same. 'Paul Mirengoff, Power Line Blog\nAfter Republicans lost in 2012, failing to retake the White House and actually losing Senate seats despite a sagging Obama-era economy, two prominent analyses were proposed. One---the Republican National Committee's 'autopsy'---said the GOP's problem was embracing social issues too much and liberal immigration too little. The other analysis---the 'Missing White Voter' thesis---was grounded in actual data. It said the problem was that the GOP of the Bush family and Mitt Romney had turned off working-class whites to the point that they disengaged. Put another way, the GOP establishment in 2012 said the party could win by becoming more like George H. W. Bush; the deeper analysis said it could win if it became more like Ross Perot. 'Ross Perot didn't 'give us Trump.  But he gave us an insight into what America was really like. It just took 20 years for someone to put that insight to use.\n\nRight:\nBoth men convinced large numbers of Americans that it was better to have a successful business executive to solve the nation's problems. Their pitch was that experience in the law, statecraft, diplomacy and government were irrelevant to seeking the highest office in the land---indeed such qualifications were corrupting. H. Ross Perot pioneered the insurgent trail that Trump rode to victory.\nHis television platform was Larry King Live, not The Apprentice, and his persona was genial and folksy, not blustery and dark. But more than a quarter century ago, Ross Perot revealed a truth about the American electorate that Donald Trump would exploit: There is a big chunk of voters who feel disaffected, harmed by free trade, threatened by demographic change, and attracted to an eccentric outsider who promises to upend the status quo.\nPerot, like Donald Trump, attracted a lot of disaffected white non-college graduates. A lot of these types of voters would later jump to the Republican Party and power Trump's presidential victory in 2016. But to call Perot the first Trump probably doesn't do either man enough justice. Trump's brand of populism is far angrier than Perot's ever was. And Perot dealt with slights differently than Trump. When he was called 'crazy,  Perot adopted the song 'Crazy' as his 'campaign song,  even dancing to it. In this way and many others, Perot was one of a kind.\nNothing remotely like to the accusations of personal corruption that surround Trump ever arose in connection with the fastidious Perot, a famed/infamous moral scold. Perot was married to the same woman for 62 years and was said to be a loyal, if difficult employer (his company had a 'moral code' that prohibited infidelity). Trump is the ultimate symbol of excess; Perot bragged about never owning more than three or four pairs of underpants at a time as a young person. Apart from criticism of NAFTA, a protectionist bent, and a general disdain for the two parties, they didn't have much in common.\nMany of Mr. Perot's predictions about Nafta's impact---notably his claim of the 'giant sucking sound' Americans would hear as businesses shuttered operations in the United States---proved either wrong or overstated. Paradoxically, however, his skepticism about lowering trade barriers has proved prescient. The 'sucking sound' from Mexico was never really heard, but there certainly was one from China after it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.

Think of what Trump is saying here: Michelle Obama really screwed up her speech because she said 150, 000 Americans had died from coronavirus when, in fact, that number is now well over 170, 000. 'What Trump's comment reinforces is his belief that he bears no responsibility -- and is not blamed by the public -- for the country's ongoing struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Reminding people that in the relatively short period of time between when Michelle Obama taped her convention speech and when it ran on Monday night, an additional 20, 000 Americans have died from Covid-19 is a disastrous self-own by Trump.\nRegarding the party's platform, 'There's no endorsement of Medicare-for-all, no call to defund the police, no call to abolish ICE, no call to ban fracking, no support for legalizing marijuana nationwide, and no backing of free college for all. But it's hard to characterize this platform as moderate. On health care, the platform calls for free Covid-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines for all, for making a generous public option for health insurance available to all Americans, and for empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. 'On the climate crisis, the platform calls for major new clean energy spending, and for eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 (an earlier target than Democrats previously proposed). It proposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, significantly increasing the child tax credit, and aggressively increasing the supply of housing (including affordable housing). Overall, the platform isn't a radical break from Democrats' past---this is Joe Biden we're talking about---but it contains a very wide-ranging suite of progressive proposals.\nProgressives want to hear that conservative policy ideas have failed on a practical level and are about to be swept aside in favor of an entirely new agenda. Somewhat ironically, it's former president and centrist extraordinaire Bill Clinton who delivered a speech that was closest to that spirit on Tuesday---talking about 'good jobs in green energy and conservation to combat climate change' and creating 'a living wage, and access to affordable higher education and health care, including prescription drugs, child care, a secure retirement, and paid family and medical leave. . 'Meanwhile Jill Biden's speech reminded us that we've been suffering through months of a void of emotional leadership, living in a country whose head of state doesn't seem to realize or care that this is a difficult situation. The moment of connection with a person who grasps exactly how bad things are was, ironically, the single most hopeful moment of American politics in months.\nThe convention lineup seems tailored to appeal to older Americans and longtime voters. But sidelining figures who appeal to the young is a missed opportunity to build Democratic Party loyalty. Democrats made the right choice to highlight Barack Obama, then a 43-year-old Senate candidate, to deliver the 2004 keynote address, which propelled him to the presidency four years later.

S. population. 'Moreover, Cuomo bears considerable responsibility for at least 6, 700 deaths of people in care facilities, and possibly many thousands more, because of his health commissioner's mandate in March that nursing homes admit Covid patients after being discharged from the hospital. Last night, Cuomo explained what he saw as a key lesson of the pandemic: 'How vulnerable we are when we are divided and how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent.  He was referring to leadership in Washington, but the governor could just as easily have been talking about his own governance.\nThe first night of the Democratic National Convention focused heavily on the coronavirus and the effects it has had on people across the country, but there was one massive omission: China. The CCP still has not produced truthful data on how many people the virus killed in China, and the propaganda it fed the world through the World Health Organization led to nations putting their guard down on the virus. China sold faulty medical equipment to countries in need and silenced whistleblowers, all while trying to blame the U. S. military for causing the outbreak.

China caused this, and China, at least rhetorically, should pay the price.\nThe one deficiency of Tuesday's convention, which is no small deal, was the total lack of discussion on policy. Bill Clinton strongly criticized Trump for his handling of the pandemic, but offered little indication of how Biden would have handled it differently if president. Would Biden have tried to enact a nationwide lockdown? Would he have demanded Congress spend more money on relief? . The Democrats have calcified their pitch against Trump. They have made a case for Biden's decency, but they have yet to make a compelling case that Biden can make a real difference on the coronavirus, the economy, or any of the numerous other issues on deck.\nAfter all the hype, the Democratic Party's Me Too-era reckoning over Bill Clinton ended with the former president getting a speaking slot at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

For someone who says she hates politics, Michelle Obama is a political powerhouse.\nThe President was asked about the former first lady's speech at the Democratic National Convention. 'She taped it. And it was not only taped, it was taped a long time ago, because she had the wrong deaths. She didn't even mention the vice presidential candidate. . Think of what Trump is saying here: Michelle Obama really screwed up her speech because she said 150, 000 Americans had died from coronavirus when, in fact, that number is now well over 170, 000. 'What Trump's comment reinforces is his belief that he bears no responsibility -- and is not blamed by the public -- for the country's ongoing struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Reminding people that in the relatively short period of time between when Michelle Obama taped her convention speech and when it ran on Monday night, an additional 20, 000 Americans have died from Covid-19 is a disastrous self-own by Trump.\nRegarding the party's platform, 'There's no endorsement of Medicare-for-all, no call to defund the police, no call to abolish ICE, no call to ban fracking, no support for legalizing marijuana nationwide, and no backing of free college for all. But it's hard to characterize this platform as moderate. On health care, the platform calls for free Covid-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines for all, for making a generous public option for health insurance available to all Americans, and for empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. 'On the climate crisis, the platform calls for major new clean energy spending, and for eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 (an earlier target than Democrats previously proposed). It proposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, significantly increasing the child tax credit, and aggressively increasing the supply of housing (including affordable housing). Overall, the platform isn't a radical break from Democrats' past---this is Joe Biden we're talking about---but it contains a very wide-ranging suite of progressive proposals.\nProgressives want to hear that conservative policy ideas have failed on a practical level and are about to be swept aside in favor of an entirely new agenda. Somewhat ironically, it's former president and centrist extraordinaire Bill Clinton who delivered a speech that was closest to that spirit on Tuesday---talking about 'good jobs in green energy and conservation to combat climate change' and creating 'a living wage, and access to affordable higher education and health care, including prescription drugs, child care, a secure retirement, and paid family and medical leave. . 'Meanwhile Jill Biden's speech reminded us that we've been suffering through months of a void of emotional leadership, living in a country whose head of state doesn't seem to realize or care that this is a difficult situation. The moment of connection with a person who grasps exactly how bad things are was, ironically, the single most hopeful moment of American politics in months.\nThe convention lineup seems tailored to appeal to older Americans and longtime voters. But sidelining figures who appeal to the young is a missed opportunity to build Democratic Party loyalty. Democrats made the right choice to highlight Barack Obama, then a 43-year-old Senate candidate, to deliver the 2004 keynote address, which propelled him to the presidency four years later. Instead of unfurling a vision that inspires millions of young people, the party's next Obama might be spending convention week tweeting her impressions from the sidelines.",
        "document": "The Democratic Convention's first night no doubt had the loyalists tune in and leave the box on, but the traditional conventions draw their miserable ratings for the funny hats the Texas delegates wear, for the crazies outside the hall and for the panel discussions broadcasting from bars and coffee shops. Rarely do the networks actually cover the speeches, and even when they do, they cut away frequently to other things. It's the energy of the real conventions that made them at all watchable. This was, in a word, unwatchable. 'Republicans should learn from the Democrats' fiasco and switch it up quickly for their convention next week. The best choice is 20 hours of President Trump interviews with 20 different interlocutors. He's still the best interview in America. Trump knows TV. That's why he won the 2016 debates---all of them. His inner programmer knows he doesn't need to share the stage. Sure, put the candidates in key Senate races in prime time for 15 minutes, but just because the Democrats jumped off a ratings cliff doesn't mean the GOP has to follow them.\nListening to Governor Cuomo, one would think that he had not in fact presided over the nation's, and perhaps the world's, most disastrous Covid-19 response. New York State has seen about 34, 000 Covid-related deaths, out of a national total of 170, 000, which means that New Yorkers have died at a rate close to four times what would be expected based on their proportion of the U. S. population. 'Moreover, Cuomo bears considerable responsibility for at least 6, 700 deaths of people in care facilities, and possibly many thousands more, because of his health commissioner's mandate in March that nursing homes admit Covid patients after being discharged from the hospital. Last night, Cuomo explained what he saw as a key lesson of the pandemic: 'How vulnerable we are when we are divided and how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent.  He was referring to leadership in Washington, but the governor could just as easily have been talking about his own governance.\nThe first night of the Democratic National Convention focused heavily on the coronavirus and the effects it has had on people across the country, but there was one massive omission: China. The CCP still has not produced truthful data on how many people the virus killed in China, and the propaganda it fed the world through the World Health Organization led to nations putting their guard down on the virus. China sold faulty medical equipment to countries in need and silenced whistleblowers, all while trying to blame the U. S. military for causing the outbreak. You wouldn't know this from watching the Democratic National Convention, though. 'In its singular focus on winning in November, the Democratic Party is going to let China get away with causing a global pandemic. The party has thus far managed more anger for those calling it the 'Wuhan virus' than for the Chinese government letting it spread from Wuhan to America. China caused this, and China, at least rhetorically, should pay the price.\nThe one deficiency of Tuesday's convention, which is no small deal, was the total lack of discussion on policy. Bill Clinton strongly criticized Trump for his handling of the pandemic, but offered little indication of how Biden would have handled it differently if president. Would Biden have tried to enact a nationwide lockdown? Would he have demanded Congress spend more money on relief? . The Democrats have calcified their pitch against Trump. They have made a case for Biden's decency, but they have yet to make a compelling case that Biden can make a real difference on the coronavirus, the economy, or any of the numerous other issues on deck.\nAfter all the hype, the Democratic Party's Me Too-era reckoning over Bill Clinton ended with the former president getting a speaking slot at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The move is evidence Clinton's power in the party hasn't diminished to the degree many expected, which is itself evidence that the Democratic establishment's bluster about Me Too was more about political expediency than women. Al Franken should be in revolt."

They need to do so to let primary voters make an informed choice. And they need to do so before Donald Trump launches an onslaught of nativist attacks next year. The 2020 Democratic candidates don't actually support open borders. They're just not yet comfortable explaining why.\nDemocrats can also spend more time talking about the party's emerging solutions to the single most urgent crisis in the news right now. Plans have been introduced by House Democrats and Senate Democrats. These plans include things such as increased funding to Northern Triangle countries; creating additional in-country options for asylum seekers to apply for refugee status from afar to disincentivize the trek to the border; big investments in judges and programs to track asylum-seeking families awaiting hearings; and so forth. There's more consensus here than you think.\nSome argue, 'Activists are pressing candidates to take aggressively progressive stands on broad issues like Medicare-for-all but also narrower ones like including undocumented immigrants in health care plans and providing relief from graduate school debt. This is, however, precisely the wrong lesson to learn from the Trump era. It's true that Trump is president, but it's nottrue that Trump ran and won as an ideological extremist. 'Trump ran as an Iraq War opponent who vowed to avoid new Middle Eastern military adventures, as an opponent of cutting Social Security and Medicare (and Medicaid), and as the first-ever Republican candidate to try to position himself as an ally to the LGBTQ community---going so far as to actually speak the words 'LGBTQ'. Far from being a counterexample to the theory that moderation pays off, Trump's election is, if anything, a testament to its power. The millions of progressives baffled that someone as coarse, ignorant, and scandal-plagued as Trump could win an election should reflect on the fact that he was able to partially recover from those things due to his positions on the issues.\nOthers ask, 'In what sense are the Dems moving too far left? . Voters want to raise taxes on the rich and expand government social programs. In moving to the left on taxes and spending, then, Democrats are actually moving toward voters' preferences, not away from them. On fiscal and economic responsibility: Nobody who endorsed the 2017 tax cut has any right to criticize Democratic proposals to spend more on things like child care. That tax cut, after all, appears likely to add around $2 trillion to federal debt---with around a third of that going to foreigners. Meanwhile, the promised surge in business investment is nowhere to be seen. 'Last but not least, if your view is that the progressive agenda is morally wrong, that people shouldn't receive more in government benefits than they pay in taxes. then you should be calling on 'donor' states like New Jersey and New York to cut off places like Kentucky and let their economies collapse. And if that's what you mean, you should let Mitch McConnell's constituents know about it.\n\nRight:\nThe Democrats are doing everything they can to keep the Flight 93 panic alive on the right. They're doing this by running so far to the left that many Trump-skeptical Republicans feel like they have no choice but to vote for him again (I hear this from my fellow conservatives every day). Democratic candidates have openly praised socialism, the Green New Deal, the abolition of private insurance, voting rights for incarcerated felons, federal funding of abortion late into pregnancy, confiscatory 'wealth taxes,  and even the right to sex-change operations paid for by taxpayers.\nThe Democrats seemed to be tag-teaming to prove Republican talking points. While the consensus Democratic position appears to be allowing people to buy into a Medicare-type insurance program, enough Democrats are pushing 'Medicare-for-all' that they run the risk of the public thinking that is their overall approach. Another example was 'open borders.  Trump and the Republicans often speak about how the Democrats are for 'open borders,  or allowing anyone to enter the country, regardless of need for asylum or ability to contribute to society. I'm not sure that's the consensus Democratic view. But when asked about what they would do about people crossing the border, no Democrat seemed to take the position that the U. S. should be able to decide (fairly) who needs to be offered asylum and who could be---safely and fairly---refused entry.\nOn several polarizing issues, Democrats are refusing to offer the reassurances to moderate opinion that they once did. They're not saying: We will secure the border and insist on an orderly asylum process, but do it in a humane way; we will protect the right to abortion while working to make it less common; we will protect gun rights while setting sensible limits on them. The old rhetorical guardrails---trust us, there's a hard stop on how far left we'll go---are gone.\nBiden had a lane all to himself in the debate Thursday night, but he couldn't stay in it. Biden's drift to the left---supporting health care for illegal aliens, expressing strong distaste for deporting any of them who hadn't committed major crimes---is illustrative of a Democratic party held hostage by its woke minority. Twice as many Democrats are over 65 than are under 30. More than half of Democrats who voted in 2018 identify themselves as moderate or conservative. 'Very liberal' Americans account for only 19 percent of the party's voters. There is absolutely no need for Biden to be afraid of the Left. He was doing fine without them, they're absolutely prepared to vote for him over Trump, and what Democrats crave is electability, which they think he's got more of than anyone else. He doesn't need to buy off the activists during primary season. But he did it anyway.\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi's Democrats far outdid Hillary Clinton's 2016 performance. Pelosi's Democrats won the popular vote over Republicans by 6. 7 points nationwide. How? By relentlessly talking about pocketbook issues, particularly the Democrats' commitment to protecting voters' existing health-insurance arrangements. Attack ads against Republicans in 2018 focused on the provision of a bill that would have weakened protections for those with preexisting conditions. Pelosi's Democrats said Republicans would 'raise your premiums' and 'kick you off your health-care plan'. 'For good measure they accused Republicans of 'doubling the debt.  Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tried to tamp down the story of the migrant caravan then traveling through Mexico, calling President Trump's focus on it a distraction from health care. Pelosi's Democrats retook the Rust Belt districts that Donald Trump had won in 2016. She must have watched the Democratic primary debates in horror.\nA presidential election loss discredits the party's insiders, and so the outsider grassroots say, with vehemenceand oftentimes no little justificationit's our turn, give us a chance. Thus the activists, fired by ideological zeal, seize control of the party's nomination. 'They raise their voices, walk the precincts, show up at meetings, flock to the polls, and generally set the tone for the party. That's how the left-wing Senator George McGovern of South Dakota won the 1972 Democratic nomination. There was no social media back then, but if there had been, McGovern would have dominated Democratic Twitter. Yet of course, dominating the intra-party discussion is not the same thing as winning an inter-party election. So while McGovern surged to win the Democratic nomination in the summer of 1972, he crashed in his actual bid to win the White House that November. He crashed badly, in facthe lost 49 states.",

They're not saying: We will secure the border and insist on an orderly asylum process, but do it in a humane way; we will protect the right to abortion while working to make it less common; we will protect gun rights while setting sensible limits on them. The old rhetorical guardrails---trust us, there's a hard stop on how far left we'll go---are gone.\nBiden had a lane all to himself in the debate Thursday night, but he couldn't stay in it. Biden's drift to the left---supporting health care for illegal aliens, expressing strong distaste for deporting any of them who hadn't committed major crimes---is illustrative of a Democratic party held hostage by its woke minority. Twice as many Democrats are over 65 than are under 30. More than half of Democrats who voted in 2018 identify themselves as moderate or conservative. 'Very liberal' Americans account for only 19 percent of the party's voters. There is absolutely no need for Biden to be afraid of the Left. He was doing fine without them, they're absolutely prepared to vote for him over Trump, and what Democrats crave is electability, which they think he's got more of than anyone else. He doesn't need to buy off the activists during primary season. But he did it anyway.\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi's Democrats far outdid Hillary Clinton's 2016 performance. Pelosi's Democrats won the popular vote over Republicans by 6. 7 points nationwide. How? By relentlessly talking about pocketbook issues, particularly the Democrats' commitment to protecting voters' existing health-insurance arrangements. Attack ads against Republicans in 2018 focused on the provision of a bill that would have weakened protections for those with preexisting conditions. Pelosi's Democrats said Republicans would 'raise your premiums' and 'kick you off your health-care plan'. 'For good measure they accused Republicans of 'doubling the debt.  Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tried to tamp down the story of the migrant caravan then traveling through Mexico, calling President Trump's focus on it a distraction from health care. Pelosi's Democrats retook the Rust Belt districts that Donald Trump had won in 2016. She must have watched the Democratic primary debates in horror.\nA presidential election loss discredits the party's insiders, and so the outsider grassroots say, with vehemenceand oftentimes no little justificationit's our turn, give us a chance. Thus the activists, fired by ideological zeal, seize control of the party's nomination. 'They raise their voices, walk the precincts, show up at meetings, flock to the polls, and generally set the tone for the party. That's how the left-wing Senator George McGovern of South Dakota won the 1972 Democratic nomination. There was no social media back then, but if there had been, McGovern would have dominated Democratic Twitter. Yet of course, dominating the intra-party discussion is not the same thing as winning an inter-party election. So while McGovern surged to win the Democratic nomination in the summer of 1972, he crashed in his actual bid to win the White House that November. He crashed badly, in facthe lost 49 states.\n\nRight:\nThe best course for Democrats, in elections and in government, is to develop a new agenda that synthesizes progressive values with conservative wisdom. Sanders has spent a lot of time in this campaign, as he did in 2016, defending socialism. It's a losing and unnecessary battle. Democrats actually believe in capitalism. They just don't like the ruthless, runaway version that has betrayed and antagonized working people. 'Healthy capitalism starts with stronger competition. When powerful companies aren't regulated, the first thing they do is crush or buy out their competitors to escape market pressure. To preserve the market, the government has to constrain such behavior. It's true that much of what was said on stage was dogmatic, tone-deaf, and self-destructive. But that's only half the story. The other half is that through these debates, Democrats are beginning to articulate new ways of thinking about these problems and solving them.\nThe Democratic candidates are talking more honestly about health care than about immigration. To develop a coherent approach to immigration in an era of rising asylum claims, Democrats need to explainamong other thingswhom they would and wouldn't let in. One of the internationally accepted legal criteria for who deserves asylumfear based on 'membership of a particular social group'is extremely vague. Different immigration judges interpret it in vastly different ways. Since those judges currently work for the attorney general, and thus ultimately for the president, the Democratic candidates need to clarify what standard they support. They need to do so to let primary voters make an informed choice. And they need to do so before Donald Trump launches an onslaught of nativist attacks next year. The 2020 Democratic candidates don't actually support open borders. They're just not yet comfortable explaining why.\nDemocrats can also spend more time talking about the party's emerging solutions to the single most urgent crisis in the news right now. Plans have been introduced by House Democrats and Senate Democrats. These plans include things such as increased funding to Northern Triangle countries; creating additional in-country options for asylum seekers to apply for refugee status from afar to disincentivize the trek to the border; big investments in judges and programs to track asylum-seeking families awaiting hearings; and so forth. There's more consensus here than you think.\nSome argue, 'Activists are pressing candidates to take aggressively progressive stands on broad issues like Medicare-for-all but also narrower ones like including undocumented immigrants in health care plans and providing relief from graduate school debt. This is, however, precisely the wrong lesson to learn from the Trump era. It's true that Trump is president, but it's nottrue that Trump ran and won as an ideological extremist. 'Trump ran as an Iraq War opponent who vowed to avoid new Middle Eastern military adventures, as an opponent of cutting Social Security and Medicare (and Medicaid), and as the first-ever Republican candidate to try to position himself as an ally to the LGBTQ community---going so far as to actually speak the words 'LGBTQ'.

Severe restrictions on individual liberties need to be justified by a compelling government interest---like fighting a pandemic. They must also be targeted ('narrowly tailored,  in constitutional-law speak) to achieving that compelling goal. But here is where things get a little weird: stay-at-home orders are narrowly tailored to avoiding the spread of the disease. Barr couldn't plausibly claim otherwise. 'The Barr memo is meant to ramp up the pressure on states to reopen, and fits with Trump's apparent electoral strategy of pressing for faster reopenings. It's part of the Justice Department's job to look out for citizens' civil rights and civil liberties. It would be a bad idea to turn that high responsibility into a political tool to help the president's reelection campaign. Especially when lives are at stake.\nPeople have been arrested for hanging out on Brooklyn street corners in too large numbers. People have been fined for gathering in large groups on Los Angeles beaches. It's not discrimination when the same health and safety rules are applied equally to all. When states enforce rules against such gatherings, they are not singling out 'religious observance.  They are including religious observance on a list defined by the most neutral of possible terms: risk of infection. 'It's especially not discrimination to apply universal health and safety rules to religious assemblies when there is ample evidence that religious assembliesmuch more than beaches or parkshave proved capable of spreading the virus. An outbreak in Georgia traces to a church funeral in Dougherty County, one in Louisiana to a megachurch that ignored social distancing.\nThe constitutional guarantee of civil liberties is not absolute, and its abridgment is not necessarily an act of tyranny. Dangerous speech---falsely shouting 'fire' in a theater and causing panic, in Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. 's pointed example---is no more protected than dangerous assembly. 'In this pandemic, the reach of an individual's freedom to be foolish ends an inch away, where the next individual is entitled to protection against the peril posed by the fool's heedlessness. Hence the closure of concert halls, sports arenas, restaurants and gyms. For now, the same rationale justifies and requires closing the doors to churches, synagogues, mosques and other traditional venues of worship."

Texas.\nThe attacks on Hagedorn's faith crossed a red line. At issue was a single, vital question: 'Can a Bible-believing Christian still hold office in the state of Wisconsin? . . .

The election may not be a referendum on the Smollett case specifically, but it's at least one of the Chicago machine as a whole. For all that progressives in the city like to brand themselves as, choosing Lightfoot over a union-backed career crony is actual change and progress.\n\nRight:\nWisconsin voters on Tuesday delivered a stinging defeat to Democrats hoping to hold a seat on the state Supreme Court---and a hint that a sleeping Republican base is beginning to wake up just in time for the 2020 presidential election. The results underscore what should be obvious by now: Wisconsin is a closely divided state at the tipping point of either party's path to 270 electoral votes.\nIn a rare stroke of luck, Wisconsin conservatives managed to rally behind a reactionary judge so extreme, two of the GOP's most reliable donors---the state's Chamber of Commerce and Realtors Association---could not bring themselves to support him. While we were all debating a presidential primary that's still ten months away, many progressives slept through an immensely consequential---and, by most accounts, easily winnable---election against a reactionary bigot in Wisconsin (again).\nIn a result eerily reminiscent of the 2016 presidential election in the state, liberals' heavy focus on social and culture war issues they believed would be disqualifying over pocketbook issues appeared to backfire, as a surge in the vote from more culturally conservative areas around greater Green Bay, exurban Milwaukee and Wisconsin's Northwoods more than made up for big turnout in Madison, while Milwaukee's turnout once again lagged behind the state.\nMeanwhile in Chicago, an open letter to the incoming mayor: 'You were the candidate of Chicagoans who can't find a good school for their kids. Who wonder why they're paying more in property taxes while wealthy developers get tax breaks. Who can't find a mental health clinic in a family emergency. Who don't dare let their children play outside.\nLike no mayor before you, you are in a position to demand that big developers do more for the neighborhoods, that the wealthiest residents and corporations pay a fairer portion of taxes, that neighborhood schools come before charter schools, and that affordable housing be extended to every ward. You made history, Lori Lightfoot. Now make more.\nMany note that 'the United States is experiencing a socialist surge right now. That surge came to Chicago Tuesday night, where democratic socialists won big. You've got at least five, maybe six democratic socialists who will be on the 50-member Chicago city council. Throughout the country, people are tired of low wages, soaring housing costs, privatization of public goods, budget cuts and corporate giveaways of public money. They have tried austerity and found it miserable. If Chicago's elections are any indication, maybe they're ready to try socialism.",

They have tried austerity and found it miserable. If Chicago's elections are any indication, maybe they're ready to try socialism.\n\nRight:\nRepublicans received an unexpected piece of good news on Tuesday night. Trump knows that he needs to win only the electoral college to get reelected, and that encourages him to double down on issues that motivates Republicans and blue-collar former Democrats. That coalition makes up about half the vote in Wisconsin, without Trump on the ballot and without a nationally known progressive as his opponent. Tuesday's result should warm Republican hearts with the hope that maybe the president, despite everything, is becoming a slight favorite for reelection.\nRepublicans have reinforced their court majority with Mr. Hagedorn, a mainstream conservative jurist who served as counsel to Mr. Walker. The left vilified him for giving speeches to the 'hate group' Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented Colorado's cake-baker in a winning appeal to the U. S. Supreme Court. The left's smear campaign prompted some business groups to pull back advertising but may have also energized Republicans. Republicans were able to beat back a liberal surge by winning the suburbs where liberals in recent elections had been gaining. Perhaps the emerging radicalism on the left is causing voters to think twice about returning them to power.\nLiberals overplayed their hand attacking religious and social conservatives. Neubauer and her liberal allies vilified Hagedorn as an anti-LGBT bigot because he had founded a Christian school that upholds Christian beliefs regarding sex and marriage, and because he had echoed comments from Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in Lawrence v. Texas.\nThe attacks on Hagedorn's faith crossed a red line. At issue was a single, vital question: 'Can a Bible-believing Christian still hold office in the state of Wisconsin? . . .

Was Trump riding shotgun in the SUV after the speech? Of course not. Surely he was sitting in the back, where reaching for the steering wheel is likely an impossibility. I believe even the presidential SUVs (he didn't use the usual limo that day) have considerable partitions between the passenger section and the driver's compartment at the front. Where was agent Engel sitting if Trump tried to choke him? .\nAnd why hasn't this story leaked out before now if it is true (or even ifespecially ifit isn't)? Ditto for her other stories of Trump throwing plates of food on the wall at the White House. We've heard plenty of stories of Trump's temper tantrumsI've heard a few first hand from individuals on the receiving end of thembut nothing like this. This is where the lack of an actual Republican on the January 6 committee comes into play, because any amount of cross-examination would raise these questions in public and require some kind of explanation.\nIt's difficult to know how much this story is leaving out, since the committee isn't releasing full transcripts of its interviews. There's also no questioning from Republicans who boycotted the committee. But some of the testimony is firsthand, such as when Ms. Hutchinson said she saw a White House valet cleaning up food and broken dishes that Mr. Trump had thrown in a rage about the election. Ms. Hutchinson is a former intern for GOP Whip Steve Scalise and Sen. Ted Cruz. She is speaking under oath.\nDemocrats want to use the Jan. 6 investigation to paint the entire Republican Party as a gang of insurrectionist nuts. The committee is steeped in partisanship. But that doesn't mean Republicans should look away from the considerable evidence it is producing.\nSome argue, 'Even if Trump didn't try to commandeer his vehicle, he still plainly and clearly exhorted a mob he allegedly knew was armed to march on the Capitol. Trump further inflamed the mob while the Capitol attack was underway. One of the most compelling moments in previous hearings was the video evidence that the crowd 'surged' immediately after Trump tweeted (during the heat of the fight) that 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what was necessary. . 'Other statements made by Trump allies before and during the January 6 rally itself include: Steve Bannon evoked the beaches of Normandy. Michael Flynn drew comparisons to Civil War battlefields and spoke of Americans who died for their country. Roger Stone called it a struggle 'between the godly and the godless, between good and evil.  Rudy Giuliani called for 'trial by combat.  Ali Alexander said it would be a 'knife fight.  These words render Trump's admonition to 'fight like hell' and his warning on January 6 that 'you will never take back our country with weakness' even more ominous in context. Trump was not a man trying to stop a riot.\n\nRight:\nOn the morning of the insurrection, Hutchinson testified, Cipollone urged her to prevent Trump from going to the Capitol building with the growing, seething crowd of protesters he had assembled nearby. Hutchinson described the scene this way: Mr. Cipollone said something to the effect of, 'Please make sure we don't go up to the Capitol, Cassidy. Keep in touch with me. We're going to get charged with every crime imaginable if we make that movement happen. .\nKeep in mind that one of Cipollone's jobs as White House counsel was to keep people who work in the White House, including the president, from committing crimes---something that, according to Hutchinson, he was clearly worried about. Notably, Cipollone's fear intensified as Jan. 6 wore on. Hutchinson testified that as the riot spun out of control, Cipollone came 'barreling down the hallway towards our office' to tell Meadows they had to talk to the president.\nShe continued: And Mark looked up and said, 'He doesn't want to do anything, Pat.  Cipollone then replied, 'Mark, something needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood is going to be on your f---ing hands. This is getting out of control. I'm going down there. \nHutchinson testified that Trump and Meadows were alerted to the threat of violence days before January 6. She testified that Trump ordered Meadows to consult with alleged co-conspirators, such as his ephemeral national security adviser Michael Flynn and longtime Republican agitator Roger Stone, who had attended events with members of the Oath Keepers and other groups that have since been tied to the deadly attack. She testified that Trump objected to the use of weapons screening for people who attended his 'Stop the Steal' rally and who would later storm the Capitol. It was a coup, and Trump fully intended to lead it.\nHutchinson's account establishes that Trump knew the crowd was armed and understood they were there to threaten or harm someonespecifically, his opponentsand that he wanted them to march on the Capitol with those weapons.\nOnce the rioters had begun to approach the Capitol, Trump refused to lift a finger to stop the violence. When the top White House lawyer told Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that the president had to act, Meadows replied, according to Hutchinson, 'He doesn't want to do anything.  Later, when rioters chanted that Pence should be hanged, Hutchinson recalled, Meadows told the same lawyer, 'He thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong. .\nSome of Trump's defenders will, of course, seek to explain Hutchinson's testimony away and apologize for him. They will contend that if the president wasn't heard explicitly saying, I want a violent mob to topple Congress, harm members, and overturn the election that I lost, he cannot be held responsible for what happened that day. This is nonsense. If you pour gasoline all over a building, tell some people it is essential the building burn, and make sure they're carrying matches and lighters, you are to blame for the arson that followsespecially if you then decline to call the fire department and condone the inferno. What Trump wanted to put up in flames on January 6 was American democracy.",

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Right-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Right '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nYovanovitch was not the ambassador to Ukraine during the period when the Trump administration withheld military aid. She has no knowledge as to why the aid was held up. That's the only issue of relevance to the impeachment proceedings. The proceedings aren't about whether Yovanovitch should have been removed as ambassador. Schiff's committee isn't a human resources body or a personnel review board. 'Democrats may say that Yovanovitch's removal is relevant because it was the first step in making U. S. policy towards Ukraine subservient to Trump's political interests. It set the stage, so to speak. But this argument collapses the moment one remembers that Yovanovitch was replaced by Bill Taylor (officially, he's the charge d'affaires, but he acts as ambassador). If there's one thing on which Democrats and Republicans on Schiff's committee agree, it's that Taylor is an exemplary diplomat.\nSome are critical of firing Yovanovitch. 'Trump was given bad advice, and unfortunately, he listened. It's not clear exactly why Trump chose to recall Yovanovitch, but it's likely his decision was influenced by Giuliani and others in Ukraine who wanted Yovanovitch gone. Now let's be clear: As president, Trump has every right to recall a foreign diplomat for any reason he sees fit. Yovanovitch, as she's admitted, served at the pleasure of the president. But as of yet, no one has offered a good reason for why Yovanovitch should have been removed, defaulting instead to a political 'because I said so.  Trump should not have listened to Giuliani, whose sole concern while meddling in Ukrainian affairs was self-advancement.\nOthers contend, 'For any readers persuaded by former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch's congressional testimony today that she was the key to a free and independent Ukraine free of corruption, it's worth noting that. the Obama administration helped Yovanovitch prepare to field questions at her Senate confirmation hearing in June of 2016 about Hunter Biden's role on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nMany are pointing to the case of Francisco Erwin Galicia as evidence that the system is broken. 'A Dallas-born U. S. citizen, Galicia spent 23 days in the custody of U. S. Customs and Border Protection in conditions that made him so desperate he almost opted to self-deport. Galicia says he lost 26 pounds during that time in a South Texas immigrant detention center because officers didn't provide him with enough food. He said he wasn't allowed to shower and his skin was dry and dirty. He and 60 other men were crammed into an overcrowded holding area where they slept on the floor and were given only aluminum-foil blankets, he said. Some men had to sleep on the restroom area floor. 'It's one thing to see these conditions on TV and in the news. It's another to go through them,  he said.\nHis detention was hardly an isolated mistake---hundreds of American citizens have now been detained on suspicion that they are living illegally in the United States, including a man held in custody for 1, 273 days. The entire system of checkpoints, detention centers and immigration agents hunting for Hispanics---along with all the horror of children penned in disgusting conditions and a cascade of immigration policies that violate fundamental rights---perverts American values and traditions. 'It should be in the DNA of the American people, the overwhelming majority of whom are themselves descendants of immigrants who found refuge, opportunity and happiness in the United States, to approach this crisis with humanity.\nAt least seven children have died while in such circumstances and many more are suffering from lice, scabies, chicken pox, and other afflictions. Yet when doctors from the American Association of Pediatricians traveled to the camps to offer their help, their services were refused. It's hard not to assume that, however overwhelmed Customs and Border Protection may be, at least some of this treatment is intentional. 'Why else turn away doctors offering help or refuse supplies of donated aid sent by worried citizens? Why arrest a humanitarian aid volunteer who gave food and water to two ill and desperate undocumented Central American migrants and tried to get them medical help? The administration acknowledges that the overall situation is dire, but its officials on the spot have basically thrown up their hands, complaining that they have been overwhelmed by the situation they created. The rest of the administration refuses even to admit to the appalling conditions.\nRegarding 'the Trump administration's expansion of the use of fast-track deportations through 'expedited removal'. it will create a 'show me your papers' regime nationwide in which people---including citizens---may be forced to quickly prove they should not be deported. This policy allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to quickly deport someone without going before an immigration judge, undermining American principles of fundamental fairness and putting United States citizens, permanent residents and asylum-seekers at risk of wrongful deportation. In expedited removal proceedings, immigration officers serve as both prosecutor and judge---charging someone as deportable and making a final decision to deport him, often all within a day. 'Moreover, there is typically no judicial oversight, with relatively low-level government officers authorized to issue the deportation orders. Immigration officers applying expedited removal are obligated to inform individuals of their opportunity to seek asylum and refer a person who expresses a fear of returning to their home country for a 'credible fear interview.  Unfortunately, multiple investigations have revealed that officers at the border sometimes fail to fulfill these obligations.\nIn the final two years of the Obama Administration, ICE had a clear mandate: only convicted criminals and certain recent arrivals were priorities for arrest. The overall idea was to spare those who were law-abiding and had deep personal ties to the U. S. One of the first things Trump did after taking office was to rescind those priorities, making anyone unlawfully in the U. S. subject to deportation. 'Among Democrats no one is willing to say who they are willing to deport,  Cecilia Munoz, who worked in the Obama White House, told me. 'It sounds harsh, but you need to be able to articulate that so you can be clear about who you want to protect. \nRegarding Guatemala, 'In pressuring the country to accept a deal to absorb vast numbers of asylum seekers, the Trump administration has embarked on a dramatic and risky strategy to slash the number of Central Americans flooding the U. S. border. The accord---which was negotiated in secret and signed at the White House on Friday---could plunge Guatemala's young democracy into a constitutional crisis. the agreement is built on a fragile political and legal base. 'The Guatemalan Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that President Jimmy Morales needed approval from the Guatemalan Congress to sign the accord, something he has not received. On Saturday, hundreds of people demonstrated in front of the presidential palace in Guatemala City to protest the agreement.\n\nRight:\nOne of the reasons CBP facilities suffer overcrowding and backlogs is that ICE facilities are built for long-term holding of illegal aliens. CBP facilities are meant for short-term holding. But due to the massive increase in illegal immigration, ICE's systems are collapsing, leaving CBP to bear the brunt of the surge. Galicia's story is yet another example of how the southern border crisis urgently needs congressional attention to the roots of the problem: American asylum laws' vulnerability to immigration fraud.\nWhat we're witnessing is a mass exodus from Central America driven above all by poverty but made possible by a broken asylum and immigration system in the United States. The scale of this exodus is hard to convey. About 17 million people live in Guatemala. Since October of last year, 235, 638 Guatemalans have been apprehended by U. S. Border Patrol. That means over the past nine months nearly 1. 4 percent of the entire population of Guatemala has been apprehended and processed by U. S. authorities. 'A 2016 survey by the International Organization for Migration found that more than 90 percent emigrated to the United States for economic reasons. According to the report, '56. 8 percent of Guatemalans migrate in search of better employment, 32. 9 percent to improve their income, 1. 2 percent to buy a home, and 0. 1 percent to open businesses.  Only 0. 3 percent say they migrate because of violence, and 0. 2 percent cite gang problems.\nWhat we have done at our borders for so many decades is not working. Most of the politicians we have elected have failed miserably. There has been plenty of talk, promises and fundraising when it comes to securing our borders, but little progress toward truly accomplishing that goal. We finally have a chance to get something substantive done. We finally have a chance to make our country and its citizens safer. We finally have a chance to gain control of an immigration system that so many call 'broken' but do nothing to fix.\nNo one would claim that a border wall will reduce the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs to zero. But just because a measure doesn't totally solve a problem doesn't mean we should take no action. Our nation, states and localities do a great deal to reduce the toll of deaths and injuries from traffic accidents. We set speed limits, design roads to minimize accidents, and require vehicles to have safety belts and meet other safety standards. Unfortunately, people still get killed and hurt in traffic accidents. But many more would lose their lives if we said there was no point in setting any safety standards because they couldn't eliminate all deaths and injuries. A border wall is one piece of the much-needed infrastructure that the men and women of the Border Patrol need to protect our nation.\nAmerican citizens don't have freestanding rights to walk into court and challenge administration expenditures. They have to show that they have standing---that the specific plaintiffs suffered a concrete and legally-recognized injury as a result of the government's action. In this case, while the private parties were claiming that the diversion of funds created concrete harms on the ground along the southern border, it's less clear how the plaintiffs themselves were harmed by the government's action. 'The Supreme Court may ultimately decide this case on the merits. but for now it's right to cast doubt on a sweeping lower-court injunction granted on behalf of plaintiffs who haven't yet been able to adequately articulate the legally recognized harms they've suffered in what is ultimately a battle between Congress and the president of the United States.\nThe Justice Department reports that, as of late May, federal district courts had issued 37 nationwide injunctions against executive actions by the Trump Administration. By our count the number is now at least 39. This compares with two such injunctions in the first two years of the Obama Administration, and both of those were vacated by the Ninth Circuit. These legal stays are supposed to be issued only in the most extreme circumstances. Too often these days they are issued as a first resort and on mistaken legal grounds. 'The proliferation of national injunctions has inserted judges into policy debates in ways they should avoid and can sometimes pre-empt debate in the political branches where the issues should be settled. Lifting the injunction in the border case should also give the district court and Ninth Circuit an incentive to speed up a decision on the merits. Courts have been taking their sweet time on immigration cases, almost as if they hope to push the disputes past the 2020 election. These injunctions aren't in the public interest, and the High Court needs to police them.\nSome, however, argue that 'for Republicans to back the president on that question is to support a broad expansion of executive power at the expense of Congress. If federal courts refuse to rein in an executive that flouts the rule of law in order to bypass an uncooperative Congress, then the constitutional power of Congress is weakened and the president, already much more powerful than the Framers envisioned, becomes even stronger and less accountable.",

This policy allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to quickly deport someone without going before an immigration judge, undermining American principles of fundamental fairness and putting United States citizens, permanent residents and asylum-seekers at risk of wrongful deportation. In expedited removal proceedings, immigration officers serve as both prosecutor and judge---charging someone as deportable and making a final decision to deport him, often all within a day. 'Moreover, there is typically no judicial oversight, with relatively low-level government officers authorized to issue the deportation orders. Immigration officers applying expedited removal are obligated to inform individuals of their opportunity to seek asylum and refer a person who expresses a fear of returning to their home country for a 'credible fear interview.  Unfortunately, multiple investigations have revealed that officers at the border sometimes fail to fulfill these obligations.\nIn the final two years of the Obama Administration, ICE had a clear mandate: only convicted criminals and certain recent arrivals were priorities for arrest. The overall idea was to spare those who were law-abiding and had deep personal ties to the U. S. One of the first things Trump did after taking office was to rescind those priorities, making anyone unlawfully in the U. S. subject to deportation. 'Among Democrats no one is willing to say who they are willing to deport,  Cecilia Munoz, who worked in the Obama White House, told me. 'It sounds harsh, but you need to be able to articulate that so you can be clear about who you want to protect. \nRegarding Guatemala, 'In pressuring the country to accept a deal to absorb vast numbers of asylum seekers, the Trump administration has embarked on a dramatic and risky strategy to slash the number of Central Americans flooding the U. S. border. The accord---which was negotiated in secret and signed at the White House on Friday---could plunge Guatemala's young democracy into a constitutional crisis. the agreement is built on a fragile political and legal base. 'The Guatemalan Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that President Jimmy Morales needed approval from the Guatemalan Congress to sign the accord, something he has not received. On Saturday, hundreds of people demonstrated in front of the presidential palace in Guatemala City to protest the agreement."

CBP facilities are meant for short-term holding. But due to the massive increase in illegal immigration, ICE's systems are collapsing, leaving CBP to bear the brunt of the surge. Galicia's story is yet another example of how the southern border crisis urgently needs congressional attention to the roots of the problem: American asylum laws' vulnerability to immigration fraud.\nWhat we're witnessing is a mass exodus from Central America driven above all by poverty but made possible by a broken asylum and immigration system in the United States. The scale of this exodus is hard to convey. About 17 million people live in Guatemala. Since October of last year, 235, 638 Guatemalans have been apprehended by U. S. Border Patrol. That means over the past nine months nearly 1. 4 percent of the entire population of Guatemala has been apprehended and processed by U. S. authorities. 'A 2016 survey by the International Organization for Migration found that more than 90 percent emigrated to the United States for economic reasons. According to the report, '56. 8 percent of Guatemalans migrate in search of better employment, 32. 9 percent to improve their income, 1. 2 percent to buy a home, and 0. 1 percent to open businesses.  Only 0. 3 percent say they migrate because of violence, and 0. 2 percent cite gang problems.\nWhat we have done at our borders for so many decades is not working. Most of the politicians we have elected have failed miserably. There has been plenty of talk, promises and fundraising when it comes to securing our borders, but little progress toward truly accomplishing that goal. We finally have a chance to get something substantive done. We finally have a chance to make our country and its citizens safer. We finally have a chance to gain control of an immigration system that so many call 'broken' but do nothing to fix.\nNo one would claim that a border wall will reduce the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs to zero. But just because a measure doesn't totally solve a problem doesn't mean we should take no action. Our nation, states and localities do a great deal to reduce the toll of deaths and injuries from traffic accidents. We set speed limits, design roads to minimize accidents, and require vehicles to have safety belts and meet other safety standards. Unfortunately, people still get killed and hurt in traffic accidents. But many more would lose their lives if we said there was no point in setting any safety standards because they couldn't eliminate all deaths and injuries. A border wall is one piece of the much-needed infrastructure that the men and women of the Border Patrol need to protect our nation.\nAmerican citizens don't have freestanding rights to walk into court and challenge administration expenditures. They have to show that they have standing---that the specific plaintiffs suffered a concrete and legally-recognized injury as a result of the government's action. In this case, while the private parties were claiming that the diversion of funds created concrete harms on the ground along the southern border, it's less clear how the plaintiffs themselves were harmed by the government's action. 'The Supreme Court may ultimately decide this case on the merits. but for now it's right to cast doubt on a sweeping lower-court injunction granted on behalf of plaintiffs who haven't yet been able to adequately articulate the legally recognized harms they've suffered in what is ultimately a battle between Congress and the president of the United States.\nThe Justice Department reports that, as of late May, federal district courts had issued 37 nationwide injunctions against executive actions by the Trump Administration. By our count the number is now at least 39. This compares with two such injunctions in the first two years of the Obama Administration, and both of those were vacated by the Ninth Circuit. These legal stays are supposed to be issued only in the most extreme circumstances. Too often these days they are issued as a first resort and on mistaken legal grounds. 'The proliferation of national injunctions has inserted judges into policy debates in ways they should avoid and can sometimes pre-empt debate in the political branches where the issues should be settled. Lifting the injunction in the border case should also give the district court and Ninth Circuit an incentive to speed up a decision on the merits. Courts have been taking their sweet time on immigration cases, almost as if they hope to push the disputes past the 2020 election. These injunctions aren't in the public interest, and the High Court needs to police them.\nSome, however, argue that 'for Republicans to back the president on that question is to support a broad expansion of executive power at the expense of Congress. If federal courts refuse to rein in an executive that flouts the rule of law in order to bypass an uncooperative Congress, then the constitutional power of Congress is weakened and the president, already much more powerful than the Framers envisioned, becomes even stronger and less accountable.\n\nRight:\nMany are pointing to the case of Francisco Erwin Galicia as evidence that the system is broken. 'A Dallas-born U. S. citizen, Galicia spent 23 days in the custody of U. S. Customs and Border Protection in conditions that made him so desperate he almost opted to self-deport. Galicia says he lost 26 pounds during that time in a South Texas immigrant detention center because officers didn't provide him with enough food. He said he wasn't allowed to shower and his skin was dry and dirty. He and 60 other men were crammed into an overcrowded holding area where they slept on the floor and were given only aluminum-foil blankets, he said. Some men had to sleep on the restroom area floor. 'It's one thing to see these conditions on TV and in the news. It's another to go through them,  he said.\nHis detention was hardly an isolated mistake---hundreds of American citizens have now been detained on suspicion that they are living illegally in the United States, including a man held in custody for 1, 273 days. The entire system of checkpoints, detention centers and immigration agents hunting for Hispanics---along with all the horror of children penned in disgusting conditions and a cascade of immigration policies that violate fundamental rights---perverts American values and traditions. 'It should be in the DNA of the American people, the overwhelming majority of whom are themselves descendants of immigrants who found refuge, opportunity and happiness in the United States, to approach this crisis with humanity.\nAt least seven children have died while in such circumstances and many more are suffering from lice, scabies, chicken pox, and other afflictions. Yet when doctors from the American Association of Pediatricians traveled to the camps to offer their help, their services were refused. It's hard not to assume that, however overwhelmed Customs and Border Protection may be, at least some of this treatment is intentional. 'Why else turn away doctors offering help or refuse supplies of donated aid sent by worried citizens? Why arrest a humanitarian aid volunteer who gave food and water to two ill and desperate undocumented Central American migrants and tried to get them medical help? The administration acknowledges that the overall situation is dire, but its officials on the spot have basically thrown up their hands, complaining that they have been overwhelmed by the situation they created. The rest of the administration refuses even to admit to the appalling conditions.\nRegarding 'the Trump administration's expansion of the use of fast-track deportations through 'expedited removal'. it will create a 'show me your papers' regime nationwide in which people---including citizens---may be forced to quickly prove they should not be deported.

In that case, it may be more understandable that the FBI saw some value in getting him removed from such a high-profile post, irrespective of whether he had committed a crime because of the possibility that he was compromised.\n\nRight:\nPerhaps the most important aspect of this week's documents is what isn't in them. The FBI expresses no concern that Mr. Flynn was 'colluding' with Russia or otherwise threatening national securitysupposedly the rationale for the FBI's intrusive investigation. The FBI exists to investigate crimes, not to create them.\nLet's be candid---Flynn had been cleared of being a Russian agent on Jan. 4, 2017; there was never any evidence he should have been investigated in the first place. Yet now, because the investigation had not been officially closed, FBI officials cooked up a plan to try to create a crime that did not exist. Why were they desperate to get Flynn fired or prosecuted when there was no evidence whatsoever that he committed a crime?\nThe FBI set Flynn up to preserve the TrumpRussia probe. How could the FBI sustain an investigation targeting the president when the president would have the power to shut the investigation down? The only way the bureau could pull that off would be to conceal from the president the fullness of the Russia investigation---in particular, the fact that Trump was the target. That is why Flynn had to go. 'After 33 years in the Army chain of command, the decorated former combat commander grasped that the FBI, like other executive-branch components, worked for the president. As NSA, Flynn would ensure that Trump ran the intelligence agencies, not be run by them. If Flynn wanted to know what was going on in intelligence investigations, he'd be able to find out---he wouldn't take Jim Comey's 'no' for an answer. He was loyal to Trump, not to the intelligence establishment or the 'policy community'. 'The goal was to get Flynn to lie. Not to lie so they'd have leverage to threaten a prosecution and thus pressure Flynn to reveal vital evidence he'd been concealing. They wanted him to lie for the sake of lying---so they could get rid of him.\nThe excuse the FBI has tried to use for investigating Flynn is that he allegedly violated the Logan Act---a 1799 law meant to stop private individuals from conducting foreign affairs that's widely viewed as unconstitutional, has never been successfully prosecuted and surely doesn't apply to incoming national security advisers. 'There are good reasons why lying to federal investigators is a crime. Those conducting law enforcement for the nation need that degree of power to help them ferret out the truth. But with that power comes significant responsibility. When Congress and the executive branch finish looking into the FBI's shenanigans, there must be serious consequences for those who abused their offices in pursuit of political ends. It is not the job of federal law enforcement to intimidate incoming members of an administration elected by the people just because FBI leadership thinks the people got the choice wrong.\nIn court documents filed in January, Flynn now says he did not remember the details of his conversation at the time. What's more, Comey himself has testified that the agents who interviewed Flynn in January 2017 did not believe he was deliberately misleading them. 'There remains, of course, the issue of Flynn's violation of foreign lobbying laws, which he admitted to but for which he was not charged. but the FBI until 2017 barely enforced FARA violations. A 2016 Justice Department Inspector General report found only seven times when the U. S. brought criminal charges against FARA violators between 1965 and 2015. Most violators were either fined and/or asked to file retroactively as a foreign agent, which Flynn did in March 2017. Flynn was being squeezed for crimes that are rarely, if ever, enforced. He relented only under financial pressure and a promise that his son, who worked with him in his consulting group, would not be prosecuted.\nVarious FBI officials also lied and acted in arguably criminal or unethical ways, but all escaped without charges. McCabe had a supervisory role in the Flynn prosecution. He was then later found by the Justice Department inspector general to have repeatedly lied to investigators. While his case was referred for criminal charges, McCabe was fired but never charged. Strzok was also fired for his misconduct in the investigation. Comey intentionally leaked FBI material, including potentially classified information but was never charged. Another FBI agent responsible for the secret warrants used for the Russia investigation had falsified evidence to maintain the investigation. He is still not indicted. The disconnect of these cases with the treatment of Flynn is galling and grotesque.",
        "document": "Law enforcement seldom puts all its cards on the table when questioning a suspect. This is not 'entrapment,  where one is induced to commit a crime. Rather, the F. B. I. was trying to elicit the truth of whether a crime had already been committed. The alternative would be to lay out all the evidence (which the notes also discuss). But that would have put accountability and our national security at risk by possibly discouraging Mr. Flynn from talking. 'The FBI was balancing his rights with the need to learn the truth and assessing how to do so without rattling him. Far from entrapment, that is standard operating procedure.\nThe claim that Flynn was 'set up' assumes there was no legitimate reason for his interview, that it was all just a trap. That's plainly not true. Flynn was a critical witness in a highly sensitive investigation. The FBI knew he had at least some contacts with the Russian ambassador while working for Trump. Even though agents had a recording of a call between Flynn and the ambassador, an interview was essential to ask the many follow-up questions, such as: Who asked you to make the call? What was done as a result of the call? Were there other calls or meetings? It would have been investigative malpractice for the FBI not to interview Flynn. 'Any witness interviewed by the FBI has essentially three choices: tell the truth, lie or assert the right to remain silent. The FBI had no way of knowing which option Flynn would choose when he walked into the interview. All Flynn had to do was tell the truth, or tell the agents he wasn't comfortable talking to them. He chose instead to lie. 'There is no basis for a claim that Flynn was 'entrapped.  Entrapment requires evidence that the government so pressured the defendant that his will was overborne and he committed a crime he was not otherwise predisposed to commit. Flynn was a military leader who rose to the rank of lieutenant general, led troops in combat and became national security adviser. The idea that he was so intimidated by a couple of FBI agents during a consensual interview that he simply had no choice but to lie is laughable.\nThe Flynn interview gave Flynn every opportunity to tell the truth. As the FBI's partially redacted memo documenting Flynn's interview reflects, the questions were careful. They were specific. The agents, as Strzok later recalled in a formal FBI interview of his own, planned to try to jog Flynn's memory if he said he could not remember a detail by using the exact words they knew he had used in his conversation with Kislyak. And Flynn, as he admitted in open courttwicedid not tell the truth. That is not entrapment or a set-up, and it is very far indeed from outrageous government conduct. It's conducting an interviewand a witness at the highest levels of government lying in it.\nNotably, Trump and his backers, by and large, are not saying that Flynn and Roger Stone didn't lie to federal investigators. Instead they are implying that lying to investigators doesn't matter. 'Flynn and Stone's lawyers have argued that because prosecutors have not proved that their clients conspired with Russia, their lies to investigators should be set aside. 'So much of this case deals with the question: So what?  Stone attorney Bruce Rogow said in his concluding remarks at Stone's trial. Prosecutors and judges in those cases have repeatedly dismissed those claims. Federal District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, in sentencing Stone, spoke at length on the impact of Stone's dishonesty, noting he thwarted a key part of the House's Russia investigation. 'His pride in his own lies are a threat to our most fundamental institutions,  she said, 'to the very foundation of our democracy. \nSome note that 'One very valid question raised by the new documents, though, comes when the unnamed official muses about whether the goal is to 'get him fired.  It's one thing to choose between letting Flynn admit his wrongdoing or lie about it; it's another to suggest a potential aim is his removal from his White House post. That would seem to be something that is beyond the purview of law enforcement, and it's key to claims that Flynn was personally targeted. 'But also keep in mind the then-Attorney General Sally Yates development: There was real concern around this time that Flynn had not just done something wrong, but that he had opened himself up to blackmail by the Russians because of his actions. In that case, it may be more understandable that the FBI saw some value in getting him removed from such a high-profile post, irrespective of whether he had committed a crime because of the possibility that he was compromised."

Trans people have always existed, and everyone was fine with it. The criticism of Dylan Mulvaney is about something else entirely. Women deserve more than to be lampooned and have an array of brands celebrate.\nIt's not even that the entirety of Bud Light's base reflexively rejects transgender people---rather, it's that Mulvaney, who makes a mockery of women with her puerile performance of a hyperactive, ignorant, and ridiculous preteen girl, is genuinely one-of-a-kind obnoxious. Some young people---yes, including much-maligned young, white males---will always gravitate toward cheap, reliable, and inoffensive beers, especially when hosting parties, 'fratty' soirees, or otherwise. If Bud Light explicitly rejects these customers, its competitors can and should take advantage.\nAnheuser-Busch distributors were 'spooked' by the effects of the advertising campaign, and it 'appears likely Bud Light took a volume hit in some markets over the holiday weekend,  according to Beer Business Daily. Numbers from local bars showed sales of Bud Light and other Anheuser-Busch products dropping by anywhere from 30% to 80%. And when this downturn is all over, assuming it does end, those sales will be gone forever. It's not as if all those people are going to go back and make up for all the Bud Light they didn't buy or drink in the meantime.\nIn a way, it's poetic. Bud Light thought that a man playing the caricature of a woman would appeal to its own caricature of young people, who would see a transgender TikTok user drinking their beer and then decide to become dedicated Bud Light customers. Even if the backlash from Bud Light's actual customer base fades over the coming months, it is clear that the company accomplished nothing other than hurting its own brand, all because its marketing department was deluded into thinking that social media is just like real life.\n\nRight:\nThis is not so much a story about trans rights, Dylan Mulvaney or internet outrage, as one about corporate bravery. Even Mulvaney's harshest critics must acknowledge that she is standing tall in a hurricane of hate, taking the invective with remarkable poise. In cowardly contrast, Anheuser-Busch instantly retreated into the shadows. Ditching its regular schedule of promotion, Bud Light ceased posting to Instagram on March 30 and to Twitter on April 2; Anheuser-Busch was absent from Twitter and Instagram after April 1.\n'We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people' sure sounds like a complex issue being thrown under the bus. It's frankly implausible that Bud Light gave no thought to the impact of its Mulvaney collaboration---especially as 'inclusivity' is central to the brand strategy.\nBud Light actively and eagerly sought out a controversial influencer in a dangerously polarized space, with neither the wisdom to plan for a backlash nor the bravery to stand by its partner. Bud Light's action is worse than a gaffe, it's a betrayal.\nIt's worth noting here that AB InBev is hardly some pro-trans hero. Anheuser-Busch has made multiple donations to anti-LGBTQ and anti-trans politicians over time---Popular Info has a whole rundown of the company's activities. While corporate decisions sometimes serve as flash points in America's culture wars, it's probably important to point out that, by and large, they don't have values. Or rather, they have only one: money.\nLike the Republican Party's approach to young voters, the right-wing anger at Bud Light at times misunderstands the problem that is being addressed. The New York Post, for example, suggested that brands like Bud Light are pressured into reaching out to spokespeople like Mulvaney because they're terrified of falling short on a third-party measure of their inclusivity. 'At stake is their Corporate Equality Index---or CEI---score, which is overseen by the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ+ political lobbying group in the world,  the paper's Dana Kennedy wrote Friday.\nThose under age 30 are 16 percentage points more likely to say the country hasn't gone far enough to welcome those who are transgender than they are to say we've gone too far, according to Pew. Those age 65 and up are 12 points more likely to say we've gone too far. But since much of the outcry is coming from those who view transgender Americans with hostility, the Mulvaney spot is framed as being inexplicable outside of the context of some all-powerful report card offered by a nonprofit organization.\nIt's the same response we see from people like Elon Musk to the fact that younger people are more likely to vote Democratic: It must be because they are somehow indoctrinated.

Some young people---yes, including much-maligned young, white males---will always gravitate toward cheap, reliable, and inoffensive beers, especially when hosting parties, 'fratty' soirees, or otherwise.

It's not as if all those people are going to go back and make up for all the Bud Light they didn't buy or drink in the meantime.\nIn a way, it's poetic. Bud Light thought that a man playing the caricature of a woman would appeal to its own caricature of young people, who would see a transgender TikTok user drinking their beer and then decide to become dedicated Bud Light customers. Even if the backlash from Bud Light's actual customer base fades over the coming months, it is clear that the company accomplished nothing other than hurting its own brand, all because its marketing department was deluded into thinking that social media is just like real life."

Impeachment must be the only solution to Trump's challenge to the constitutional order. The Constitution did not envision that the criminal justice system would address abuses of presidential power. The Constitution makes Congress alone accountable for removing a President who abuses his office."

Cutting food stamps is not one of them. what's striking is that the Trump proposal comes despite the absence of a glaring mismatch between the number of people in poverty and the number receiving SNAP.

Otherwise, more children and adults in our affluent country will go hungry.\n\nRight:\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) writes, 'When welfare reform first inserted work requirements into our welfare system in 1996, some on the Left predicted doom for America's most vulnerable families. but Between 1996 and 2000, single-mother welfare caseloads fell by 53%, their employment rate increased by 10 percentage points, and their poverty rate fell by 10%. The number of SNAP recipients used to rise during recessions and then quickly fall as the economy recovered. But due to eligibility loopholes instituted under President Barack Obama, that didn't happen after the most recent recession. A full ten years after the recession ended in 2009, the share of the U. S. population receiving SNAP is 40% higher now than when the recession began in 2007.\nThe 1996 welfare reform proved the effectiveness of work requirements. And if Congress disagrees, it's welcome to write some new rules into the law rather than leaving these decisions to the executive branch. 'Many on the left complain about the rule simply because it will reduce the number of people on food stamps---by about 700, 000, roughly 2 percent of total food-stamp enrollment, by the administration's own estimate. But increasing benefit receipt is not an end in itself, especially when it comes at the expense of an incentive for childless, able-bodied adults to find work; and given the massive growth the program has seen these past two decades, there is clearly room for cuts. Perhaps more to the point, whatever one's ideal level of food-stamp enrollment, there is no good reason to gut work requirements for entire areas with low unemployment while enforcing those requirements elsewhere---or to let states play games with their maps to boost eligibility.\nThe rule applies to a group called 'able-bodied adults without dependents' or ABAWDs. In recognition of the difficult job market during the Great Recession, ABAWD work requirements were waived in all states as part of the federal stimulus legislation in 2009. But after the economy recovered and unemployment fell to historic lows, some states still found ways to maintain their ABAWD waivers, using tactics such as combining distant jurisdictions while excluding low unemployment areas. 'Illinois is a good example of how states have gerrymandered the waiver process to exempt ABAWDs, even during good economic times. For a previously approved waiver application, Illinois grouped all counties in the state together as an 'economic area'---with the exception of low-unemployment DuPage County---in order to expand the total area that qualified for a waiver. Most Illinois counties would not qualify for a waiver on their own due to favorable economic conditions. California, with its current 3. 9 percent unemployment rate, did the same, combining all but six low-unemployment counties in their waiver request. As a result, ABAWDs in 90 percent of California counties are exempt from the work requirement.\nWith the U. S. unemployment rate now at 50-year lows, there are seven million job openings for only six million job seekers.

When it's time to spend a fraction of that to help poor people eat, that's when the well has supposedly run dry.\nThough helping or encouraging people to experience the 'dignity of work' is a laudable goal. experts I spoke to say there is little evidence that food stamp receipt discourages work. Most food-stamp beneficiaries already have jobs; among those who don't, or who don't work sufficient hours, it is difficult to believe that the only thing keeping them from meeting this requirement is that it doesn't suck enough to be poor. 'The population affected by this new rule, after all, involves the neediest---on average, they make just 18 percent of the poverty line---so it's not as though food stamps enable them to live a life of comfort and convenience. Especially when you consider that their average monthly SNAP benefits are $165, or about $1. 83 per meal. the Trump administration is pushing people off the rolls and making it more difficult for state policymakers to respond the next time there is a sudden spike in unemployment. Which means Trump officials aren't just exporting anti-poor antipathy to the states; they're exporting Washington's policy gridlock, too.\nCertain tweaks could boost the workforce. Cutting food stamps is not one of them. what's striking is that the Trump proposal comes despite the absence of a glaring mismatch between the number of people in poverty and the number receiving SNAP. In fact, there appears to be a pretty close correspondence between the two: Roughly 38 million people live in poverty and roughly 38 million get SNAP, according to government data.\nDated but relevant: 'Food stamps are now the only form of public assistance available to many struggling families during hard times: when their jobs don't pay enough, when they face eviction, or when they experience health problems and other emergencies. These hardships can strike anyone: 1 in 5 Americans uses SNAP at some point in their lives. 'If the government wants to make food-assistance programs like SNAP obsolete, it needs to address the real problems in our economy that make it difficult for families to afford food: things like miserly wages, expensive housing, exorbitant health care costs and inadequate support for the unemployed. Until those changes are made, the least we can do is expand and bolster our existing food-assistance programs. Otherwise, more children and adults in our affluent country will go hungry.",
        "document": "Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) writes, 'When welfare reform first inserted work requirements into our welfare system in 1996, some on the Left predicted doom for America's most vulnerable families. but Between 1996 and 2000, single-mother welfare caseloads fell by 53%, their employment rate increased by 10 percentage points, and their poverty rate fell by 10%. The number of SNAP recipients used to rise during recessions and then quickly fall as the economy recovered. But due to eligibility loopholes instituted under President Barack Obama, that didn't happen after the most recent recession. A full ten years after the recession ended in 2009, the share of the U. S. population receiving SNAP is 40% higher now than when the recession began in 2007.\nThe 1996 welfare reform proved the effectiveness of work requirements. And if Congress disagrees, it's welcome to write some new rules into the law rather than leaving these decisions to the executive branch. 'Many on the left complain about the rule simply because it will reduce the number of people on food stamps---by about 700, 000, roughly 2 percent of total food-stamp enrollment, by the administration's own estimate. But increasing benefit receipt is not an end in itself, especially when it comes at the expense of an incentive for childless, able-bodied adults to find work; and given the massive growth the program has seen these past two decades, there is clearly room for cuts. Perhaps more to the point, whatever one's ideal level of food-stamp enrollment, there is no good reason to gut work requirements for entire areas with low unemployment while enforcing those requirements elsewhere---or to let states play games with their maps to boost eligibility.\nThe rule applies to a group called 'able-bodied adults without dependents' or ABAWDs. In recognition of the difficult job market during the Great Recession, ABAWD work requirements were waived in all states as part of the federal stimulus legislation in 2009. But after the economy recovered and unemployment fell to historic lows, some states still found ways to maintain their ABAWD waivers, using tactics such as combining distant jurisdictions while excluding low unemployment areas. 'Illinois is a good example of how states have gerrymandered the waiver process to exempt ABAWDs, even during good economic times. For a previously approved waiver application, Illinois grouped all counties in the state together as an 'economic area'---with the exception of low-unemployment DuPage County---in order to expand the total area that qualified for a waiver. Most Illinois counties would not qualify for a waiver on their own due to favorable economic conditions. California, with its current 3. 9 percent unemployment rate, did the same, combining all but six low-unemployment counties in their waiver request. As a result, ABAWDs in 90 percent of California counties are exempt from the work requirement.\nWith the U. S. unemployment rate now at 50-year lows, there are seven million job openings for only six million job seekers. Yet as of last year 2. 1 million potential hiresspecifically, adults age 18 to 49, able-bodied, without dependentswere receiving food stamps despite not working. 'The Foundation for Government Accountability calculated in August that the average jobless rate in waived areasmore than 1, 100 jurisdictions across 33 stateswas 4. 5%. 'Nearly half,  the report said, 'have unemployment rates at or below four percent'. There are always difficult and sympathetic cases. But if Democrats oppose even this modest stepa part-time work requirement, applied to childless, able-bodied adults, in an economy with unemployment at 3. 6%then they might as well say that getting food stamps is a permanent way of life."

Call the GOP the enemy of Hispanics\nTrump is a symptom of the slow-rolling collapse of civil institutions, brought about in large part by the disingenuous gaslighting in which Obama engaged for a decade: promoting a better discourse while engaging identity politics, championing supposed honesty in politics while simultaneously presiding over an administration rife with malfeasance. . . Obama drove the Right mad. Now Trump has driven the Left mad.\nRegarding his policies, 'we can't pretend that Obama somehow respected the press while his administration actively targeted them. . . it obtained the records of more than 20 phone lines connected to the Associate Press over a two-month period back in 2013. It also seized records from five phone lines connected to Fox News. \nObama claimed to have made the world more secure. . . How easily he forgets his 'Russia reset,  his cancelation of U. S. missile defense in Europe, his rush to eliminate America's nuclear weapons, his retreat from Syria, his open-mic promise to show 'more flexibility' to Putin after the 2012 election. \nEconomic growth during the Obama years should have been unusually high, since he took office the year after a financial collapse and stabilization. Growth is usually strongest after recessions. But during the Obama years, economic growth averaged only around 2 percent. . . Annual economic growth is now averaging about 3 percent and the last quarter saw rapid growth at an annualized rate of 4. 2 percent. . . Unemployment for women and minorities is near historic lows, as it is for all Americans.\nFinally, Obama initially 'set out with two goals, publicly to unite the country and privately to unite it under the Democrats. . . He transparently failed at the former goalthe country is more divided than beforeand the only political realignment he engendered was a strange and raucous one that favored the Republicans, who picked up more than 1, 000 state legislature, gubernatorial, and congressional seats during his presidency."

In an era of rising Russian aggression and continuing terrorist threats, NATO continues to be an alliance of paramount importance.\nNATO's efficacy defending Europe has allowed successive U. S. Administrations to shift their focus elsewhere, lately toward China and domestic concerns. Yet Russian revanchism under Vladimir Putin shows NATO's continuing relevance. The challenge for NATO's future is for Western Europeans to overcome their entitlement complacency to spend enough for their common defense. As for the U. S. , NATO is a modest investment in deterrence to prevent a European war that America would have to return to Europe to fight. NATO at 70 is a challenged alliance but still a necessary one.\nDated But Relevant: 'Germany, one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, spends just 1. 24 percent of its gross domestic product on defense---in the bottom half of NATO allies. (The U. S. spends 3. 5 percent of GDP on its military. ). . . a German parliamentary investigation found that 'at the end of 2017, no submarines and none of the air force's 14 large transport planes were available for deployment due to repairs,  and 'a Defense Ministry paper revealed German soldiers did not have enough protective vests, winter clothing or tents to adequately take part in a major NATO mission'. . . NATO needs some tough love, and Trump is delivering it.\nThe time has also come for NATO and American leaders to say publicly what has long been known privately: that the actions of the current Hungarian government, both at home and in their relations with Ukraine, run counter to their longstanding commitment to NATO and do not keep faith with the commitment the United States has made to Hungary. Since 2017, the Hungarian government has blocked meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, the official body for consultations between the alliance and Ukraine. Hungary did so over U. S. objections and at a time of ongoing Russian military hostilities and political subversion against Ukraine.\nSome argue furthermore that 'increasingly, Turkey is no friend to America or the West. In fact, Turkey would not be invited to join the alliance today. Its international objectives are too divergent and its domestic institutions are too authoritarian. Rather than desperately attempting to hold Ankara in NATO, the allies should begin considering how to ease Turkey out. There will still be issues where we need to cooperate with Ankara. However, Washington should stop making policy based on illusions of friendship with a government seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire. Turkey today is neither friend nor ally. The U. S. should treat it accordingly.\nMinority view: 'With the Soviet Union a wasted corpse twenty-seven years after its death, what is NATO's purpose? Is a revanchist but nonetheless economically stagnant Russia really interested (let alone capable) of invading the Baltics? And with so many other priorities on its desk, is it time for the United States to at the very least transfer more security responsibility for Europe to the Europeans?"

        "stance": "left",
        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nThis week, the families of 61 million children received their final payments under the expanded Child Tax Credit. This credit has kept 10 million children above the poverty line, but it is expiring as the Senate delays a vote to renew it through the Build Back Better Act. Instead, on the same day these last payments went out, the Senate voted to approve a $778 billion military spending budget---four times as much as the annual cost of the entire Build Back Better plan. Yet we've heard endlessly about how it's Build Back Better that needs to be gutted so we can skimp and save. 'Congress is choosing to spend more on guarding the world's oil supply (at least $81 billion a year) than on the Build Back Better proposal for fighting climate change ($55 billion a year). Congress is spending more on a single military contractor, Lockheed Martin ($75 billion last year), than on the Build Back Better proposal for preschool and child care ($40 billion a year). Congress has authorized spending an extra $25 billion next year on weapons the Pentagon didn't even ask for, rather than the $20 billion a year Build Back Better proposal for poverty-busting tax credits for families and workers. Who benefits from these choices?\nLet's be clear: Manchin's excuses for opposing this bill---which would expand child-care and Medicare benefits, fight climate change and provide other support for low-income Americans---are nonsense. 'If I can't go home and explain it to the people of West Virginia, I can't vote for it,  he told 'Fox News Sunday.  But some polls have shown that West Virginians on balance support the BBB, and it would likely help West Virginia more than most states. The idea that Manchin, who's won statewide election six times, can't 'explain' a popular, useful bill to his constituents is laughable. 'The rest of Manchin's rationalizations aren't any better. 'The inflation that I was concerned about---it's not transitory, it's real. It's harming every West Virginian,  he told Fox News's Bret Baier. But numerous economists have said the BBB won't affect inflation. As White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted in an acid statement, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which Manchin is fond of citing, 'issued a report less than 48 hours ago that noted the Build Back Better Act will have virtually no impact on inflation in the short term, and, in the long run, the policies it includes will ease inflationary pressures.  Notably, Manchin did not cite any expert to rebut that view in either his Fox appearance or the statement announcing his stance.\nAlthough nearly all congressional Democrats had fallen in line with the Build Back Better Act, a small but vocal chorus of outside pundits and policy experts shared Manchin's view that the House-passed bill spread itself too thin and undercut its own political and substantive goals. The child-care provisions could raise costs for the middle class; red states would ignore funding to expand pre-K programs; the child tax credit, arguably the bill's most proven anti-poverty measure, was funded for the shortest amount of time. These critics pushed Democrats to jettison elements of their long wish list. 'The party, they said, should instead focus on proposalsthe child tax credit, a bid to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and a major investment in climate changethat polled the best and were likely to do the most good. Democrats had rebuffed these suggestions, but Manchin's stance might force them to reconsider.\nThere's still the possibility for permanent investments that would be a worthy legacy for any president or member of Congress: a historic reduction in child poverty, an unprecedented investment in climate and ecological sustainability, a couple of popular health investments, an urgently needed program to avert the next pandemic, and a little help around the edges to fill some gaps in education funding. 'Eleven and half years ago, then-Vice President Biden memorably called the ACA 'a big deal' (he inserted a present participle adjective). Now Democrats are arguing over a bill that would spend almost twice as much over the next decade as Obamacare did over the last one. There's no question that even a Manchin-sized version of Build Back Better would also be a pretty big deal.\n\nRight:\nWhile we cannot speak to any private assurances White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claims Manchin made to Biden, the West Virginia senator has publicly made his position clear for months, and. the bill in question violated many of the red lines he had drawn. 'It was more expensive, was not fully paid for, included accounting 'gimmicks' he opposed, allowed for taxpayer funding of abortion, disguised the long-term cost by trillions of dollars by funding many projects for only a few years in hopes they would become permanent, created new programs when the government cannot pay for existing ones, and added to government outlays at a time when inflation is on the rise. 'Contrary to what Psaki said, the actual flip-flop would have been Manchin's deciding to vote for Build Back Better. In doing so, he would have broken public commitments he made to West Virginians, nearly three-quarters of whom said they wanted him to oppose the bill according to a recent MBE Research poll.\nThe curious thing is that anybody is surprised. There are three Democratic senators in Trump states. Sherrod Brown has managed to win in 2006, 2012, and 2018 as a pro-labor union leader populist in Ohio (45% Biden, 43% Clinton). Jon Tester has managed to win in 2006, 2012, and 2018 as a rough-hewn rancher who lost fingers in a tractor accident in Montana (41% Biden, 35% Clinton). Both are conviction politicians who have taken some political risk over the years and have managed to win nevertheless. 'Joe Manchin is in a different position. West Virginia gave only 30% of its vote to Joe Biden and only 26% to Hillary Clinton. Discount the Biden percentage a bit, and you have three-quarters of the voters opposing BBB. And over his years as governor and senator, Manchin has not cultivated left-wing positions on economic and fiscal issues like Sherrod Brown or voted lockstep with other Democrats like Jon Tester has. Oh, and by the way, Manchin was reelected by only a 4-point margin in 2018, down from his 61% to 36% win in 2012.\nEven if something reemerges from the rubble, it is not going to be anything along the lines of the 'transformational' type of legislation liberals envisioned earlier in the year. The idea was to augment the role of government in every aspect of individuals' lives---with subsidized child care, a government takeover of preschool, more financing for college, a more generous Obamacare, and an expanded Medicare.

'None of this is meant to sound pessimistic. As a California resident, I am as hopeful that Newsom is voted out of office as anyone else. But the reality of the situation must be acknowledged. Saving California from damaging progressive policies doesn't end whenever California's glacial election count determines a winner.

It won't be a quick and easy victory, but it is doable, and it will be worth it in the long run.\nMy theory on Newsom's polling surge is that it's a combination of COVID leveling off in California at an opportune moment and Newsom being gifted with a prominent foil in Elder. But he and his party are also working hard to nationalize the race, bringing in out-of-state pols like Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar to try to grab Democrats' attention. All that stands between Newsom and an easy win is tepid Democratic engagement; he can't get California Dems excited by running on his record but he can get them motivated by having Warren tell locals to 'send a message' to Republicans across the country.\nHis campaign and its allies have gone all-out not in blaring Newsom's supposed achievements but in screaming 'racist.  In March, Newsom labeled the recall effort 'white supremacist.  His campaign website claims the drive is powered by 'a partisan, Republican coalition of national Republicans, anti-vaxxers, QAnon conspiracy theorists, anti-immigrant activists, and Trump supporters. .

Never mind that Newsom's kids got to attend in-person private school last year when California public schools remained closed.\nIf California voters recall Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sept. 14, homelessness will be a big part of the reason. According to statistics from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness in California rose 40% over the past five years. To many recall voters, the word 'homelessness' connotes less a lack of access to housing than a state spiraling out of control. Homelessness means hepatitis outbreaks and deadly encampment fires. It means parks, beaches and sidewalks strewn with needles and human waste. It means urban chaos. 'Buckets of taxpayer money have been thrown at the problem. During the 2010s, the number of permanent supportive housing units in California increased 65%, to 65, 872 from 39, 772. But the cost of constructing a single unit of housing for the homeless in California has soared, reaching as high as $750, 000 in Los Angeles. 'The state's millionaire tax generates more than $2 billion a year in dedicated funding for mental-health programs. All that money and all those programs haven't been able to prevent Los Angeles and San Francisco from becoming exhibits A and B in the ongoing national crisis of untreated serious mental illness.\n\nRight:\nCalifornia has outperformed most states in health outcomes and, particularly, in economic outcomes. 'We dominate all Western democracies in the last five years in G. D. P. ,  Newsom said. 'The G. O. P. loves G. D. P. ! Twenty-one percent G. D. P. growth in the last five years. Texas was 12 percent. And our taxes are lower for the middle class in California than they are in Texas.  Basically every economic indicator you can look at in California is booming, from household income growth to the $80 billion-plus budget surplus. But it's still been a grueling 18 months of masks, lockdowns, deaths and discord. 'As a result, people don't realize how much Newsom and the Democratic State Legislature have done. But in the two and a half years since Newsom became governor, they've more than doubled the size of California's earned-income tax credit and Young Child Tax Credit, and added a stimulus just for Californians (though some of the neediest were left out). 'They expanded paid family leave from six to eight weeks and unpaid leave to 12 weeks. They added 200, 000 child care slots and $250 million to retrofit child care centers. They passed legislation giving all public school students two free meals each day, funding summer school and after-school programs for two million children and creating a full year of transitional kindergarten for all 4-year-olds by 2025.\nBy and large, people in California have become homeless because so little affordable housing is available. That's a crisis that developed over the decades as elected state and city officials---pressured by NIMBY homeowners---fought density and did nothing to make it easier or affordable to build in this state. None of these candidates has offered clear solutions on how to change that---particularly because what would be required (rezoning, greater density, higher property taxes) is so politically volatile. 'Gov. Newsom has directed billions toward the acquisition of hotels, motels and apartment buildings to turn into housing for homeless people. He isn't perfect, but at least he's looking for creative ways to increase housing supply, not shelters.\nThe latest poll, from the Public Policy Institute of California, shows likely voters preferring to keep Newsom in office 58 percent to 39 percent. This should prompt soul-searching among California's Republicans, whose failure would make their nemesis almost untouchable in his 2022 reelection campaign. 'It's not that the party lacks talent: One of the 46 replacement candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley---a conservative Harvard- and Yale-educated lawyer from suburban Sacramento---would be gubernatorial material in any red state.

But he and his party are also working hard to nationalize the race, bringing in out-of-state pols like Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar to try to grab Democrats' attention. All that stands between Newsom and an easy win is tepid Democratic engagement; he can't get California Dems excited by running on his record but he can get them motivated by having Warren tell locals to 'send a message' to Republicans across the country.\nHis campaign and its allies have gone all-out not in blaring Newsom's supposed achievements but in screaming 'racist.  In March, Newsom labeled the recall effort 'white supremacist.  His campaign website claims the drive is powered by 'a partisan, Republican coalition of national Republicans, anti-vaxxers, QAnon conspiracy theorists, anti-immigrant activists, and Trump supporters. . 'Then talk-radio host Larry Elder jumped into the race and quickly vaulted to top of the polls. That he's black didn't stop the blitz; the left simply switched to claiming, as one Los Angeles Times piece put it, 'Larry Elder is the Black face of white supremacy.  Never mind that California has one of the highest unemployment rates, and Los Angeles County has the worst county-level jobless rate. Never mind that Newsom's kids got to attend in-person private school last year when California public schools remained closed.\nIf California voters recall Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sept. 14, homelessness will be a big part of the reason. According to statistics from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, homelessness in California rose 40% over the past five years. To many recall voters, the word 'homelessness' connotes less a lack of access to housing than a state spiraling out of control. Homelessness means hepatitis outbreaks and deadly encampment fires. It means parks, beaches and sidewalks strewn with needles and human waste. It means urban chaos. 'Buckets of taxpayer money have been thrown at the problem. During the 2010s, the number of permanent supportive housing units in California increased 65%, to 65, 872 from 39, 772. But the cost of constructing a single unit of housing for the homeless in California has soared, reaching as high as $750, 000 in Los Angeles. 'The state's millionaire tax generates more than $2 billion a year in dedicated funding for mental-health programs. All that money and all those programs haven't been able to prevent Los Angeles and San Francisco from becoming exhibits A and B in the ongoing national crisis of untreated serious mental illness.",
        "document": "California has outperformed most states in health outcomes and, particularly, in economic outcomes. 'We dominate all Western democracies in the last five years in G. D. P. ,  Newsom said. 'The G. O. P. loves G. D. P. ! Twenty-one percent G. D. P. growth in the last five years. Texas was 12 percent. And our taxes are lower for the middle class in California than they are in Texas.  Basically every economic indicator you can look at in California is booming, from household income growth to the $80 billion-plus budget surplus. But it's still been a grueling 18 months of masks, lockdowns, deaths and discord. 'As a result, people don't realize how much Newsom and the Democratic State Legislature have done. But in the two and a half years since Newsom became governor, they've more than doubled the size of California's earned-income tax credit and Young Child Tax Credit, and added a stimulus just for Californians (though some of the neediest were left out). 'They expanded paid family leave from six to eight weeks and unpaid leave to 12 weeks. They added 200, 000 child care slots and $250 million to retrofit child care centers. They passed legislation giving all public school students two free meals each day, funding summer school and after-school programs for two million children and creating a full year of transitional kindergarten for all 4-year-olds by 2025.\nBy and large, people in California have become homeless because so little affordable housing is available. That's a crisis that developed over the decades as elected state and city officials---pressured by NIMBY homeowners---fought density and did nothing to make it easier or affordable to build in this state. None of these candidates has offered clear solutions on how to change that---particularly because what would be required (rezoning, greater density, higher property taxes) is so politically volatile. 'Gov. Newsom has directed billions toward the acquisition of hotels, motels and apartment buildings to turn into housing for homeless people. He isn't perfect, but at least he's looking for creative ways to increase housing supply, not shelters.\nThe latest poll, from the Public Policy Institute of California, shows likely voters preferring to keep Newsom in office 58 percent to 39 percent. This should prompt soul-searching among California's Republicans, whose failure would make their nemesis almost untouchable in his 2022 reelection campaign. 'It's not that the party lacks talent: One of the 46 replacement candidates, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley---a conservative Harvard- and Yale-educated lawyer from suburban Sacramento---would be gubernatorial material in any red state. Another, Kevin Faulconer, a moderate former mayor of California's second-largest city, San Diego, would be a contender in any purple state. 'Instead, California Republicans are flocking to Elder, a bombastic radio talk-show host. He opposes mask and vaccination requirements, speaks fondly of Trump anti-immigration loyalist Stephen Miller, opposes any minimum wage, and is under fire for comments and behavior deemed offensive toward women. Not exactly a winning recipe in one of the bluest of blue states.\nElder's policy positions run counter to the preferences expressed by most California voters. He is anti-abortion, against public-sector unions, and opposes the minimum wagenot just California's relatively high minimum wage but any minimum wage at all. Electing him, former California governor Gray Davis said, would be a 'U-turn' for the state. 'This is a power grab by a party that can't get its candidates elected at a normal election,  Davis said."

Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich was perhaps the leading apocalypse proponent. For Earth Day, he predicted that environmental deterioration would kill 65 million Americans, and that globally, 4 billion would die before the year 2000. Not only were these predictions spectacularly wrong, but they were outlandish when first made. Yet in a world where more alarm gets more attention, they started a trend of framing environmental issues in worst-case ways. The tone scares, it depresses---and it likely skews our focus and spending.\nThe progress of economies around the world shows that environmental quality and economic prosperity go hand in hand---they are allies, not enemies. Numerous studies show that once GDP per capita reaches a certain threshold, pollution begins to plummet. Human well-being is essential to responsible care for the environment, not the other way around. The best long-term solution for our environment is to promote freedom and economic growth. 'Over the last 50 years, the United States has dramatically reduced emissions of the six key pollutants that harm human health. Lead, ozone, carbon monoxide, and other harmful airborne substances have declined by 74%---all while our economy, population, vehicle miles traveled, and energy consumption have skyrocketed. Our cities are no longer shrouded by smog and toxic fumes, despite our dramatic growth. Our unprecedented environmental successes came not at the hands of big-government programs or stifling economic growth, but rather through a careful balance of reasonable, predictable regulations and free market innovation.\nThe U. S is itself only responsible for 14 percent of global emissions. To resolve a global challenge like atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations would require more international coordination and compliance than our present geopolitics would suggest is possible. If we cannot trust the Chinese Communist Party to relay critical epidemiological information, such as the virus's genetic sequence or even the number of deaths it has caused, why should we trust it, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to enforce emissions policies detrimental to the sectors that have enabled the country's economic ascent?\nSome ask, 'When did Republicans stop leading on environmental issues? Ours is the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who championed the protection of public lands; of Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the U. S. Forest Service (and later the governor of Pennsylvania); and Richard Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency. 'I continue to support policies that embrace all sources of energy, including natural gas, which has lowered our dependence on coal. I also support nuclear power, the largest around-the-clock provider of carbon-free energy. Yet many of my conservative friends have been reluctant to join me in supporting renewable technologies such as wind and solar. These and other advancements not only address dangerous greenhouse-gas emissions, but also are helping improve our economy with new jobs.\nEnvironmental policy technologist Matt Frost states, 'I don't think there's going to be any radical discontinuity in how humans choose to organize their lives and how they choose to make their lives more comfortable. I think that our policy emphasis should be on technology breakthroughs. We should be funding carbon capture research and bringing the price on that down. 'And I do think that cheap, clean, energy is something that---especially as the people in the developing world become wealthier---is tremendously popular. Energy is the primal commodity. And so an energy breakthrough is something that we should be pushing and wishing for on a popular level and funding from a policy level---just as much as if we were in the 70s. An energy breakthrough is absolutely where a lot of human imagination and engineering talent and resources should be devoted.\n\nRight:\nMore than a quarter of all birds have vanished from the United States since 1970, a loss of nearly 3 billion animals. Over the past decade, 467 species were declared extinct. These extinctions were driven by habitat loss, overfishing, competition from invasive species, and climate change. 'Trees are an important bulwark against climate change, cooling the air around them, capturing and storing carbon, supporting other species, and cycling moisture. . . A research team last year found that helping forests recover and regenerate could soak up a large share of all the greenhouse gas emissions humanity has ever produced. Yet the world also received a shocking glimpse in the past year of how vulnerable even the mightiest forests can be. The Amazon rainforest, the world's largest tropical forest, suffered its highest rate of decline in more than a decade in 2019 driven by logging, mining, and agriculture.\nIt's startling to recall just how dirty America was in 1970. Rust Belt cities (which hadn't yet fully rusted) suffered air-pollution levels comparable to Beijing's in recent years; Los Angeles and smog were synonymous. The air in Mobile, Alabama, was so bad that it was costing people almost four years of their lives. So it wasn't hard to get people marching: estimates of participation in that first glorious Earth day run at twenty million, or ten per cent of the American population at the time. All that marching worked: the shift in the Zeitgeist forced Richard Nixon to sign one law after another, from the Clean Water Act to the Endangered Species Act. And those laws worked: air pollution has dropped by more than sixty per cent across America since 1970, and life expectancy has grown by 1. 5 years on average as a result. 'But after 1970, we chose to do the easy and obvious stuff, and we didn't transform our systemsor our outlooksin fundamental ways. Instead of pollution that you can see (and smell), in this century we're increasingly dealing with what the President might call an 'invisible enemy': the carbon-dioxide molecule. This time, there's no easy technical fix, just turning off the fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy. But that means turning off the giant companies that dominate the hydrocarbon economy. That's not an argument about sciencethat's a fight about power.\nEnvironmental writer Emma Marris states that 'It was British Petroleum that first popularized the individual carbon footprint calculator, because it really puts all of the burden and guilt about solving climate change on the individual consumer's shoulders. take the hours that you spend now feeling guilty and reallocate them to collective action. You might not change fossil fuel policy for the entire United States, but you might get a cool bike lane put in your city that encourages a lot more people to take that option to commute. It's so easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the complexities of this extremely wicked problem. And that's why we all need to do a division of labor and collective action. That's the only thing that's going to get it done.\nThe IRENA group's Global Renewables Outlook concludes that greater investment in green energy would improve the cumulative gross domestic product by $98 trillion by 2050 and bring with it 42 million jobs. The return on investment: $3 to $8 for every $1 invested. The report also found that the same capital would cut CO2 emissions by 70% by 2050; renewables would replace fossil fuels used for both the industrial and transport sectors.\nA cooler planet with more livable cities and healthier ecosystems will be in a stronger position to fight public health emergencies, especially where contagions are involved. And a better organized and funded public health system will be more equipped to address the next hurricane or flood that leaves cities and rural areas alike confronting death and disease, especially in low-income populations. Finally, with an economy in free fall, we need to put people back to work, as soon as it is safe. The U. S. clean energy industry---in companies large and small---is a smart place to focus. China has made that bet, and we should as well, if only to strengthen U. S. competitiveness.",

Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich was perhaps the leading apocalypse proponent. For Earth Day, he predicted that environmental deterioration would kill 65 million Americans, and that globally, 4 billion would die before the year 2000. Not only were these predictions spectacularly wrong, but they were outlandish when first made. Yet in a world where more alarm gets more attention, they started a trend of framing environmental issues in worst-case ways. The tone scares, it depresses---and it likely skews our focus and spending.\nThe progress of economies around the world shows that environmental quality and economic prosperity go hand in hand---they are allies, not enemies. Numerous studies show that once GDP per capita reaches a certain threshold, pollution begins to plummet. Human well-being is essential to responsible care for the environment, not the other way around. The best long-term solution for our environment is to promote freedom and economic growth.

Worst for Biden is that the complaints about the border crisis are no longer even primarily coming from Republicans.

'Next, they have the money, and more importantly the commercial awareness. European explorers only opened up the New World because there was money in it. To explore space properly, it will have to be commercially viable, as well as intellectually interesting. We will need business models as well as scientific ones. Finally, exploring space will require ambition, vision, endurance and innovation, especially when it comes to establishing colonies on Mars (one of Elon Musk's pet projects). The qualities that make for a great entrepreneur are the same that make for a great explorer. 'Matthew Lynn, Spectator WorldRegarding Bezos's critics, let's 'leave aside the fact that the government spent massively more money fighting poverty in the 1960s than it did sending a man to the moon, yet five decades later, poverty remains undefeated. Leave aside also the incoherence of arguing that we should be spending more money on various social programs and yet finding it worse, not better, that this round of space exploration has not asked for taxpayer support. The fact is, we can feel national pride in the accomplishments of our fellow citizens---inventors, athletes, artists, healers, explorers, captains of industry---even if they were not funded by forced exactions from our pockets by the taxman. 'Yes, this is a vanity project by rich men. So what? It's their money. Rich men's vanity projects have a long history in this country, a history that often led to progress and to public benefit.

'That isn't a flaw or a problem or a failure; it's how the system works, and how the system should work.

She was a fierce fighter for Trump's America First policies. We'll see how far she gets. Does she make it past the early states in the primary? We'll see how she does with fundraising and how long she can hang in there. She'd be a good vice-presidential candidate. Just a thought.\n\nRight:\nIn the video, 'She solemnly attacks liberals who say the U. S. 's 'ideas are not just wrong but racist and evil'. In fact, what leftist critics invariably say is that the U. S. 's ideas are noble, but their implementation has been hypocritically lacking.\nNext, Haley briefly pivots to the foreign-policy chops she developed at the U. N. , saying that while leftists see the U. S. 's founding ideas as evil, 'I've seen evil.  This is handled clumsily as well. Haley says nothing about her accomplishments while serving in the Trump administration but includes a disturbing and unexplained reference to soldiers killing a baby.\nAnd when it comes to the moment of Haley's governorship that brought her national attention---indeed, embarrassingly fawning coverage from the mainstream media---the video pulls its punch. There's no mention of Haley's famous decision to remove a Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds in the 2015 Charleston church shooting's aftermath. Perhaps she feels that call won't go over well with today's GOP-primary voters.\nShe eventually did support the guy who'd called for a ban on all Muslims entering the country and boasted on tape of sexually assaulting womenthe man who reminded her of the forces that unleashed 'hate' on her state. And then she went to work for the guy. And then she endorsed him for reelection. And then she went back to denouncing Trump after January 6th, saying that 'his actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history' and that 'we can't let that ever happen again.  And then, several months later, she said that she would support him again. Now, Haley has changed her mind once more.\nHaley is not the only Republican candidate expected to challenge Trump. She's not even the only big-name Republican from South Carolina expected to challenge Trump. Sen. Tim Scott is also seriously considering a run.\nShe's also not the only former Trump administration official who could challenge their old boss. Former Vice President Mike Pence has been courting social conservatives. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently released a memoir and is attacking President Joe Biden's foreign policy in interviews this week. Former President Donald Trump's attempt to clear the field has officially failed.",
        "document": "Haley's record as governor was generally conservative. She signed a 20-week abortion ban at a time when she was constrained by Roe v. Wade still being on the books. And she advanced gun rights by signing a bill that presumptively allowed licensed individuals to bring their concealed firearms into bars and restaurants (unless explicitly prohibited by the businesses). On fiscal issues, her record was less impressive. She pushed tax cuts, with limited success, but failed to restrain general-fund spending.\nEarly polling indicates there is a genuine risk that Haley is just the sort of candidate who doesn't do nearly well enough to contend for the nomination, but just well enough to help split the vote and put Trump over the top. This is especially a risk if her candidacy doesn't take off but she decides to stick around until her home state of South Carolina votes. At the same time Nobody deserves to be anointed the nominee this far in advance, and Haley deserves the opportunity to make her case.\nHaley brings clear strengths. She was a popular Governor, held a cabinet-level position in a foreign-policy role, and brings racial and gender diversity to the GOP field. She also has charisma and can light up a room of Republicans.\nThe bigger challenge for Ms. Haley is identifying the rationale for her candidacy beyond a winning persona. Her campaign announcement stressed a belief in America as a force for good, the seriousness of global threats, and the follies of the progressive left. Is there a Republican presidential candidate who believes something different? She hasn't staked out any clear domestic policy directions, and she doesn't have an obvious core of support.\nTed Kennedy famously fizzled in the 1980 Democratic primary when he couldn't answer the question 'Why do you want to be President?  Ms. Haley needs her own answer.\nCan Nikki Haley capture the imagination of voters? I think she can. Her personal story is a compelling one. Born and raised in a small town in South Carolina, she speaks to growing up being different. She doesn't dwell on that, though, and repeats advice her mother gave her to use her differences as an opportunity. That is refreshing in today's world where everyone wants to cash in on victimhood. She reminds me of a happy warrior, as Ronald Reagan used to say.\nWho doesn't remember how proud we were when she stood up to brutal tyrants at the U. N. during her time there?

Kennedy Jr. From a strategic perspective, it's not even, and never will be, a live question about whether or not Biden should debate Kennedy.\nImagine a debate in which the big question is whether Ron DeSantis or Mike Pence is more personable. Imagine a debate where Tim Scott and Nikki Haley end up swapping South Carolina anecdotes. Imagine a debate where North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum explains why the United States needs another billionaire president. Or, Republicans can just get real and admit that a Fox News debate without the party's front-runner, the man who has literally remade the GOP in his own image, is not a debate at all.\nWhether Trump shows up in Milwaukee or not, the spotlight will be on him. Not on DeSantis. Not on Pence. Not on Christie. And not on the only GOP contender who seems to have gained anything akin to momentum, billionaire-wannabe Vivek Ramaswamy, whose over-the-top enthusiasm for Trump seems to suggest he is really running for a place on the former president's vice-presidential short list.\nTrump's ambiguity has made debate prep difficult for the rest of the GOP field.

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nOn the morning of the insurrection, Hutchinson testified, Cipollone urged her to prevent Trump from going to the Capitol building with the growing, seething crowd of protesters he had assembled nearby. Hutchinson described the scene this way: Mr. Cipollone said something to the effect of, 'Please make sure we don't go up to the Capitol, Cassidy. Keep in touch with me. We're going to get charged with every crime imaginable if we make that movement happen. .\nKeep in mind that one of Cipollone's jobs as White House counsel was to keep people who work in the White House, including the president, from committing crimes---something that, according to Hutchinson, he was clearly worried about. Notably, Cipollone's fear intensified as Jan. 6 wore on. Hutchinson testified that as the riot spun out of control, Cipollone came 'barreling down the hallway towards our office' to tell Meadows they had to talk to the president.\nShe continued: And Mark looked up and said, 'He doesn't want to do anything, Pat.  Cipollone then replied, 'Mark, something needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood is going to be on your f---ing hands. This is getting out of control. I'm going down there. \nHutchinson testified that Trump and Meadows were alerted to the threat of violence days before January 6. She testified that Trump ordered Meadows to consult with alleged co-conspirators, such as his ephemeral national security adviser Michael Flynn and longtime Republican agitator Roger Stone, who had attended events with members of the Oath Keepers and other groups that have since been tied to the deadly attack. She testified that Trump objected to the use of weapons screening for people who attended his 'Stop the Steal' rally and who would later storm the Capitol. It was a coup, and Trump fully intended to lead it.\nHutchinson's account establishes that Trump knew the crowd was armed and understood they were there to threaten or harm someonespecifically, his opponentsand that he wanted them to march on the Capitol with those weapons.\nOnce the rioters had begun to approach the Capitol, Trump refused to lift a finger to stop the violence. When the top White House lawyer told Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that the president had to act, Meadows replied, according to Hutchinson, 'He doesn't want to do anything.  Later, when rioters chanted that Pence should be hanged, Hutchinson recalled, Meadows told the same lawyer, 'He thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong. .\nSome of Trump's defenders will, of course, seek to explain Hutchinson's testimony away and apologize for him. They will contend that if the president wasn't heard explicitly saying, I want a violent mob to topple Congress, harm members, and overturn the election that I lost, he cannot be held responsible for what happened that day. This is nonsense.

        "document": "On the morning of the insurrection, Hutchinson testified, Cipollone urged her to prevent Trump from going to the Capitol building with the growing, seething crowd of protesters he had assembled nearby. Hutchinson described the scene this way: Mr. Cipollone said something to the effect of, 'Please make sure we don't go up to the Capitol, Cassidy. Keep in touch with me. We're going to get charged with every crime imaginable if we make that movement happen. .\nKeep in mind that one of Cipollone's jobs as White House counsel was to keep people who work in the White House, including the president, from committing crimes---something that, according to Hutchinson, he was clearly worried about. Notably, Cipollone's fear intensified as Jan. 6 wore on. Hutchinson testified that as the riot spun out of control, Cipollone came 'barreling down the hallway towards our office' to tell Meadows they had to talk to the president.\nShe continued: And Mark looked up and said, 'He doesn't want to do anything, Pat.  Cipollone then replied, 'Mark, something needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood is going to be on your f---ing hands. This is getting out of control. I'm going down there. \nHutchinson testified that Trump and Meadows were alerted to the threat of violence days before January 6. She testified that Trump ordered Meadows to consult with alleged co-conspirators, such as his ephemeral national security adviser Michael Flynn and longtime Republican agitator Roger Stone, who had attended events with members of the Oath Keepers and other groups that have since been tied to the deadly attack. She testified that Trump objected to the use of weapons screening for people who attended his 'Stop the Steal' rally and who would later storm the Capitol. It was a coup, and Trump fully intended to lead it.\nHutchinson's account establishes that Trump knew the crowd was armed and understood they were there to threaten or harm someonespecifically, his opponentsand that he wanted them to march on the Capitol with those weapons.\nOnce the rioters had begun to approach the Capitol, Trump refused to lift a finger to stop the violence. When the top White House lawyer told Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that the president had to act, Meadows replied, according to Hutchinson, 'He doesn't want to do anything.  Later, when rioters chanted that Pence should be hanged, Hutchinson recalled, Meadows told the same lawyer, 'He thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong. .\nSome of Trump's defenders will, of course, seek to explain Hutchinson's testimony away and apologize for him. They will contend that if the president wasn't heard explicitly saying, I want a violent mob to topple Congress, harm members, and overturn the election that I lost, he cannot be held responsible for what happened that day. This is nonsense. If you pour gasoline all over a building, tell some people it is essential the building burn, and make sure they're carrying matches and lighters, you are to blame for the arson that followsespecially if you then decline to call the fire department and condone the inferno.

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nPresidential elections are currently decided by swing states, ones that are less racially diverse than the country as a whole and, in 2016, represented only 35 percent of eligible voters. Last presidential election, 95 percent of candidate appearances and 99 percent of campaign spending went to fourteen states. None of them are particularly rural nor, with the exception of New Hampshire, remotely small. The swing states, due to their electoral significance, also have a stranglehold on national policies. The coal industry, for example, has outsize influence because of its prominence in Pennsylvania. So, too, does the ethanol industry because of Iowa. Moreover, U. S. tariffs have disproportionately benefited industries located in swing states, and the battleground states have historically received more in federal grants than the rest of the country.\nA presidential candidate who focused only on America's cities and urban centers would lose---there just aren't enough votes. Republicans live in cities just as Democrats live in rural areas. Under a popular vote, candidates would still have to build national coalitions across demographic and geographic lines. The difference is that those coalitions would involve every region of the country instead of a handful of competitive states in the Rust Belt and parts of the South. 'The founders feared 'direct democracy' and accounted for its dangers with a system of 'representative democracy.  Yes, this 'republic' had counter-majoritarian aspects, like equal representation of states in the Senate, the presidential veto and the Supreme Court. But it was not designed for minority rule.

Congress must develop a governance agendashared by a broad consensus of Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate, and between Congress and the White Housethat successfully challenges the now-prevailing assumption that we have no choice on Russia policy except self-imposed paralysis.

Congressional leaders from both parties must help create the political space to steer the world's nuclear superpowers away from catastrophe.\n\nRight:\nFor nearly a decade, the U. S. government tried a number of tactics to get the Russians to meet their treaty obligations. U. S. officials tried negotiations. They tried public shaming. In December, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo persuaded NATO to formally declare Russia as in breach of the treaty. None of it worked. It's fair to worry about a new nuclear arms race between the U. S. , Russia and China. The problem is that the race is already on---and the U. S. is not running.\nThe State Department says Washington has formally raised violations with Russia more than 30 times. Even Barack Obama recognized the problem as part of his belated awakening to the threat posed by Mr. Putin. But a last-ditch effort with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization failed. Arms control with adversaries rarely works, and it's impossible when Washington ignores blatant violations.\nRussia has flagrantly violated the treaty for at least the past three years and utterly rejected demands to return to compliance. Not only that, Russia also rejected repeated NATO requests to verify whether it was in compliance. . . All NATO's 28 member states agree that Russia is 'in material breach' of its obligations under the INF Treaty. 'If the U. S. did not withdraw, we'd be signaling American weakness to Russian President Vladimir Putin, spurring him to further international outrages. Abiding by our treaty obligations while Russia flouted its own would show the Kremlin it could get away with anything without Washington making a fuss.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi may have called on President Trump to exhaust every diplomatic effort to maintain the treaty, but opponents of Pelosi's position would certainly counter that the United States has been wagging its finger at Russia regarding this treaty for 13 years. It seems unlikely the next six months will change Russia's stance. 'Meanwhile China has rapidly become a dominant force in the Pacificthanks in no small part to its development of ballistic missiles that would have been in direct violation of the INF treaty, had China ever signed it. The treaty hinders America's ability to develop a well-rounded offensive or defensive position in the Pacific.  Newsrep\nRussian misbehavior aside, this ostensibly bilateral treaty is obsolete in a multilateral world, giving a strategic advantage to other adversaries. China has aggressively expanded its intermediate-range missiles to assert its influence in the Pacific while the U. S. is constrained by the INF, threatening both our posture in that theater and the security of our Pacific allies.",

Which group will win probably depends on which crisis ultimately proves to be the more genuinely frightening one to the voters. 'John O'Sullivan, National Review\nSome posit that 'while no single party, establishment or skeptic, commands a majority in the new parliament, the establishment types are still stronger. A coalition of center-right conservatives and center-liberals, or Greens, or some other combination, can maintain the broad lines of what has been the mainstream Euro-establishment program, based on the principle of a single market. None of the rebels, except the British ones, favor leaving the EU. They want to reform the Union from within, and they have various notions of what this entails. The establishment will be able to play on their needs and national interests.\nIn most countries, European themes were eclipsed by domestic fights. Despite French President Emmanuel Macron's best efforts, the campaign in France reflected the country's domestic malaise. For understandable reasons, the debate in the United Kingdom ended up being exclusively about Brexit. And in Poland, much energy was channeled into a discussion of LGBTQI issues and of sex abuse scandals in the church. For pro-EU (and anti-EU) forces, the lesson is simple: Local context matters, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, and there can be no substitute for taking domestic politics seriously.\nThe failure to pull off a timely Brexit was most likely on the minds of many in Britain as they went grudgingly to the ballot box. It helps explain why Nigel Farage's Brexit party, which is only six weeks old, won 31. 6 percent of the vote, and why the Lib Dems, back from the political wilderness, came in second with 20. 3 percent. Labour came third. The Tories came fifth. This was a protest vote for many fed up with the two main parties, clearly. What is remarkable is just how many.\nElections have consequences. And failing to execute a mandate from an election has consequences too, as both Conservatives and Labour discovered in the UK's EU elections. Despite only being weeks old and largely without a policy portfolio, the Brexit party won almost a third of the vote, outstripping the UK's two main parties---combined. voters just showed how little patience they have with parties that don't deliver on their promises.\n\nRight:\nUnderscoring the growing demand for bold climate action that has found expression in global youth-led strikes, marches and civil disobedience over the past year, Green parties across Europe had their strongest-ever EU parliamentary election performance after running on a platform of transformative environmental change.\nThe Greens' success can represent a positive turning point in European politics, if the new political energy to confront climate change is channeled into effective reforms rather than the overhyped preoccupations that sometimes animate European environmental activism.\nOverall, 'the results delivered the heartening news that Europeans still care about Europe. Europe's populist parties had wanted to make the elections a dagger in the heart of the bloc. They did increase their share of seats, from 20 percent to a robust 25 percent, but fell short of the landslide many had feared. Yet the results also showed Europe more polarized than ever. Those who wanted to support the European Union usually voted for smaller parties, like the Greens or Liberals, and voters on the right often went further right, all but abandoning the mainstream center-left and center-right parties that have controlled the European Parliament for years.\nIn the UK, 'voters are definitely unhappy with how their leaders have handled Brexit. But it's not clear what they want to do differently. One way to resolve this confusion would be to conduct another general election before the next scheduled vote in May 2022. If there was a general election tomorrow, Nigel Farage wouldn't become prime ministerdespite leading two different parties to astonishing results in European elections, he has failed in each of his seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament. Still, neither of the main parties wants to test if eighth time's the charm.\nNot long ago, many mainstream politicians and pundits viewed the far right as little more than a protest movement: People voted against the establishment in European elections to send a message, but no one really wanted these politicians to try their hand at governing. These parties were not seen as serious about policy; they were just playing politics. Now, there is no choice but to admit that the populist far right is becoming a permanent feature of European politics.\nThe far-right party led in about three-quarters of all French departements. Far-right parties also saw strong results in Poland, Hungary, and Italy. Some well-meaning liberals have cheered the fact that these forces didn't do even betterespecially in Germany, where the Alternative for Germany party won just 10 percent of the vote. Still, with nationalists topping the polls in two of Europe's three main founding nations, it's hard to see how any of this is worth celebrating. The center may be holding, but it's not on solid ground.\nSome argue, 'It was the political elites that made the populist radical right the dominant force in the political debate, adopting its issues and its frames. If the liberal democratic politicians want to, they can make this the turning point in European politics. But for that they don't need just the 'containment' of populism, they also need a coherent and convincing liberal democratic vision.

Europe's populist parties had wanted to make the elections a dagger in the heart of the bloc.

Still, neither of the main parties wants to test if eighth time's the charm.\nNot long ago, many mainstream politicians and pundits viewed the far right as little more than a protest movement: People voted against the establishment in European elections to send a message, but no one really wanted these politicians to try their hand at governing. These parties were not seen as serious about policy; they were just playing politics. Now, there is no choice but to admit that the populist far right is becoming a permanent feature of European politics.\nThe far-right party led in about three-quarters of all French departements. Far-right parties also saw strong results in Poland, Hungary, and Italy. Some well-meaning liberals have cheered the fact that these forces didn't do even betterespecially in Germany, where the Alternative for Germany party won just 10 percent of the vote. Still, with nationalists topping the polls in two of Europe's three main founding nations, it's hard to see how any of this is worth celebrating. The center may be holding, but it's not on solid ground.\nSome argue, 'It was the political elites that made the populist radical right the dominant force in the political debate, adopting its issues and its frames. If the liberal democratic politicians want to, they can make this the turning point in European politics. But for that they don't need just the 'containment' of populism, they also need a coherent and convincing liberal democratic vision. And there, the European elections did not provide much good news.\n\nRight:\nThe EU seeks 'to centralize the power and sovereignty of 27 nation-states in European institutions without solving their existing democracy deficit; to replace their independent budgetary arrangements with a single European fiscal policy without the power of tax collection; to create a common European defense structure separate from NATO without increasing anyone's defense expenditure; to replace fossil fuels with renewables to solve climate change without massive regulation, and a realistic plan to prevent a huge rise in energy costs for industry and consumers. 'It is sometimes said that the error of socialists is not that they have no faith in capitalism but that they have almost boundless faith in it. They think it can bear any burden they place on it and still stagger on delivering the goods. Modern European statesmen feel the same way about their citizens. The populists remind them they're wrong. And they haven't gone away. We could see the elections as a competition between two rising insurgent political forces---each trying not to let a good crisis go to waste: the populists using the migration crisis as an organizing principle, the Greens and the Liberals doing the same with the climate crisis. Which group will win probably depends on which crisis ultimately proves to be the more genuinely frightening one to the voters. 'John O'Sullivan, National Review\nSome posit that 'while no single party, establishment or skeptic, commands a majority in the new parliament, the establishment types are still stronger. A coalition of center-right conservatives and center-liberals, or Greens, or some other combination, can maintain the broad lines of what has been the mainstream Euro-establishment program, based on the principle of a single market. None of the rebels, except the British ones, favor leaving the EU. They want to reform the Union from within, and they have various notions of what this entails. The establishment will be able to play on their needs and national interests.\nIn most countries, European themes were eclipsed by domestic fights. Despite French President Emmanuel Macron's best efforts, the campaign in France reflected the country's domestic malaise. For understandable reasons, the debate in the United Kingdom ended up being exclusively about Brexit. And in Poland, much energy was channeled into a discussion of LGBTQI issues and of sex abuse scandals in the church.

At least Palin won her race for Alaska governor. Abrams's claim to fame is that she lost Georgia's governor's race in 2018. Indeed, she has never won a statewide race. The highest office she has ever attained is minority leader of the Georgia state House of Representatives, a part-time legislature. 'According to her official bio, her foreign policy experience is serving as a 'former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations' (a temporary membership for young people) as well holding. a string of fellowships that might qualify her for an entry-level research job at a think tank. She is an accomplished author---not of foreign policy treatises, but of romantic suspense novels. McCain later said he regretted picking Palin as his running mate. Biden would similarly regret choosing Abrams.\nPresident Trump has rewritten the rules of political experience, yet it's still a stretch to imagine someone who has only served in the Georgia legislature---and as a state representative, not even a senator---is ready to become leader of the free world. Even Pete Buttigieg has more executive experience. 'Abrams can reasonably boast of an ability to stoke turnout among minority and young voters---she won more votes than any statewide candidate in Georgia ever. But given her high-octane progressivism, she'd have limited appeal to working-class swing voters and suburban women. By picking her, Biden would also be undermining one of his chief arguments, namely, that he's a low-risk, experienced, steady hand. This means that Abrams is likely to be passed over---and, if the past is any guide, conclude that she got robbed.\nThe first rule of running mates is to do no harm. That tenet alone gives Klobuchar an extraordinary advantage. Like Biden, Klobuchar supports codifying Roe v. Wade but crucially supports late-term abortion restrictions. Similarly, Klobuchar hasn't made herself a liability by backing 2020 trends du jour such as court packing, wealth taxes, abandoning Israel, Medicare For All, or the Green New Deal. 'And perhaps most importantly, Klobuchar has already proven she's electable. Clinton won Minnesota by just one point in 2016, but Klobuchar routinely wins reelection in the solidly purple state by more than 20 points. It's not hard to imagine that battle-tested appeal translating to Michigan, Wisconsin, and maybe even Pennsylvania. if you're trying to prevent alienating the Democratic base and win over the voters who sat out 2016, Klobuchar's not a bad bet."

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nThis is a fight Democrats should be eager to take on. The first reason is that people need it. At an hourly rate of $7. 25 you're making less than $15, 000 a year, which is almost impossible for one person to live on, let alone feed and house a family. Second, minimum wage increases are incredibly popular. Polls regularly show them supported by clear majorities, and pretty much every time a state minimum wage increase is on the ballot, it passes easily. There have been 23 minimum wage ballot initiatives since 1998, and every one has succeeded. The latest was in Florida this past November, where Trump won but an initiative raising the minimum to $15 an hour passed by over 20 points.\nThe country's very low minimum wage comes at a high cost. And for taxpayers, it adds up to more than $100 billion a year. That number comes from a new analysis of safety-net usage by Ken Jacobs, Ian Eve Perry, and Jenifer MacGillvary of UC Berkeley's Labor Center. It identifies working families with at least one member who would get a raise if the federal minimum wage were lifted to $15 an hour, and finds that the government spends about $107 billion a year on Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), cash welfare, food stamps, and the earned-income tax credit for those families. Raising the minimum wage would not just help them escape poverty. It would also help the government's bottom line. 'Annie Lowrey, The AtlanticDated But Relevant: 'The conventional wisdom held that productivity growth was the only route to higher wages. Through that lens, efforts to negotiate or require higher wages were counterproductive. 'In the real world, things are more complicated. Wages are influenced by a tug of war between employers and workers, and employers have been winning. One clear piece of evidence is the yawning divergence between productivity growth and wage growth since roughly 1970. Productivity has more than doubled; wages have lagged far behind. The point is not that economists were completely wrong. Productivity obviously plays a role in determining wages. McDonald's cannot pay workers more money than it collects from its customers. But economists were partly and consequentially wrong. Power mattered, too.\nDon't be persuaded by the argument that companies can't afford to embrace higher wages. While it's true that some employers can't afford to pay more, many can. The 1, 000 largest public companies by market value employ tens of millions of people, and the median pay at roughly half of them is below a living wage. As a group, those companies have been more profitable in recent years than ever before and are widely expected to return to record profitability after the pandemic. Paying workers a living wage is a question of willingness, not ability, for much of corporate America. 'Any setbacks in hiring that a higher minimum wage might introduce to poor areas, small businesses or recession-battered companies can be addressed easily with some minor policy tweaks.

That will greatly reduce any danger of unemployment. It might even entice a few employers to shift to the low-wage areas, giving them some much-needed growth. 2 allow the government to lower the minimum wage temporarily in case of a severe recession. 3 allow small businesses to have slightly lower minimum wages.

'The effects are particularly pronounced for teenagers, for whom just one study indicates a significant increase in employment, compared with 18 that find a negative and significant effect. This observation is particularly significant given recent research evidence that finds that minimum-wage increases can lead to an increase in property crime, as young and marginally skilled people are pushed out of the labor market and instead commit crimes to get by.\nThe Congressional Budget Office looked at what would happen if we were to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and they found that it would reduce the number of jobs in the low-wage labor market by 1. 3 million. That's a reasonable estimate, but I think they're lowballing it. I think you would see significantly more jobs lost, coupled with a large drop in the number of people getting hired. While we don't have a lot of evidence on what happens when you raise a minimum wage to $15 an hour, Seattle had pretty severe employment reductions when wages hit $13 an hour. So I think a $15 national minimum wage mandate would be really devastating to the low-wage labor market.\nWhen workers make more, who pays for it? Well, some mix of business owners and customers, though the precise blend is disputed. Notably, many low-wage employers, such as discount retailers and fast-food restaurants, serve lots of low-income customers, and most minimum-wage workers do not live in poor households (because, for example, they're teenagers or second earners). This policy, therefore, doesn't just transfer money from well-to-do business owners to poor workers, but also from poor customers to middle-class workers. 'If we think people should be paid more, we should subsidize their wages with tax dollars. At least that way we'll know who's paying and who's benefiting before we set the process in motion, we won't single out the customers and employers of low-wage workers for punishment, and we won't risk throwing people out of their jobs.\nCosts of living vary significantly across the United States. It's one thing if cities like Seattle and San Francisco, or even states like New York and Illinois want to impose $15 minimum wages on their workers and businesses. If they set minimum wages above market wages, workers and employers who are priced out of the market at least have the option of going elsewhere to earn a living.

But there is concern about the praise it has lavished on China and its leadership despite the anxieties over human rights, the length of time it took China to confirm human-to-human transmission and the cover-up of the scale and seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan by authorities, which allowed Covid-19's spread within China and abroad. The organisation has treated Taiwan appallingly, thanks to its concern for relations with Beijing. But suggesting that WHO officials are in thrall to China is a facile explanation.

O. , but its worldwide budget (of which the United States pays about one-fifth) is less than that of some American hospital centers. Yet it is charged with fighting Ebola and polio, saving children's lives and keeping the world safe from pandemics like this one. It developed an effective diagnostic test that is used in dozens of countries, while the United States still cannot manage adequate testing. In late January and in February, the W. H. O. issued increasingly urgent warnings about the coronavirus. Trump ignored them, instead insisting that it was 'totally under control'. Gutting the W. H. O. will mean more kids dying of malnutrition, more moms dying of cervical cancer, and the coronavirus infecting more people in more countries.\nIn Burundi, a nation of nearly 11 million people, health care workers and communities are bracing for the first wave of coronavirus. A close friend working there estimated they have 10 ventilators. That's for the entire country. In those places where contagion will be rampant and resources are most scarce, it is the World Health Organization that has boots on the ground and will be a vital partner in saving lives. Its teams will work to flatten the curve from Burundi to Bolivia, and in so doing, help prevent the continued transmission of the novel coronavirus across borders.

Yet it is charged with fighting Ebola and polio, saving children's lives and keeping the world safe from pandemics like this one. It developed an effective diagnostic test that is used in dozens of countries, while the United States still cannot manage adequate testing. In late January and in February, the W. H.

Its teams will work to flatten the curve from Burundi to Bolivia, and in so doing, help prevent the continued transmission of the novel coronavirus across borders. They will stymie the progression of second waves like those we are actively suppressing in Asia. And they will keep the disease from coming back to America's shores, where we have already sacrificed so much to defeat it.\n\nRight:\nThe White House has made well-publicized mistakes, but that doesn't absolve the United Nations agency. A more reasonable question is whether withholding funding amid a pandemic will do more harm than good. By some estimates only about 15% of the WHO budget is dedicated to pandemic response. After Dr. Tedros shrugged off Mr. Trump's criticism last week, withholding funds can focus minds at the top of the agency without endangering work being done now. 'Another worry is that China will increase its dominance at WHO if the U. S. reduces its financial commitments. But WHO statements now frequently follow Beijing's line, which is why Chinese propaganda outlets tout them so often. With China's preferred director-general criticizing Washington and praising Beijing as a model, what influence does the U. S. have to lose?\nThe agency has yet to say a word about China's misinformation. By blindly believing Beijing's claims, the WHO wasted precious days, in which a pandemic went from possible to inevitable. Even its declaration of a pandemic on March 11 came far too late, when the virus had already spread to 114 countries. A month later, the WHO still shows no signs of admitting its errors, much less questioning China. There is no word about the mounting evidence that Beijing continues to falsify its illness and death counts, no suspicion at China's unlikely claims of no new coronavirus cases for days in a row. 'The United States should continue to withhold funding from the agency until it is seriously reformed. At the very least, its leadership should be removed, China should be suspended from full membership, and Taiwan admitted.\nDefenders of the organization often argue that the WHO can only do what it is empowered to do; and that limits its ability to question the claims made by member states like China. If so, that's all the more reason for the U. S. to demand accountability for the hundreds of millions of dollars we send to the WHO. The organization should be reformed from within, so that it has the authority to conduct independent and rigorous examinations of claims made by its members---particularly when millions of lives are potentially at risk. 'While American funding to the WHO is paused, President Trump should convene a panel of public health experts both within and outside of government. The panel should make recommendations regarding organizational improvements, but might also look for ways for the U. S. to work with other international organizations, or countries around the world, to promote public health. Indeed, if the WHO is broken beyond repair, it may ultimately be time for us to consider creating a new organization to do the important work of improving health outcomes and preventing disease around the world.\nSome admit WHO's bungling but insist that the agency is needed now to coordinate the world response. But the world is better off coordinating without the 'help' of an agency that's been packed with Beijing loyalists ever since 2006. This is not a permanent end to that US funding: It's a wake-up call that WHO must clean house to become truly non-political before it can be trusted with its official mission: 'To promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. \nSome argue that 'if Trump's brinksmanship succeeds in getting WHO officials to force China to be more transparent, then a brief suspension of funding will do a world of good. If, on the other hand, other countries step in to make up the funding shortfall, then Trump will have isolated and embarrassed the U. S. on the world stage. 'Trump is correct that the WHO has failed to perform one of its most important functions: Serving as the world's early-warning system for new infectious diseases. But his anger is misdirected. It is China that is still not being fully transparent about the outbreak. The problem is that Trump has fewer options and less leverage with China, which is a crucial link in the medical supply chain for the U. S. and much of the world. The result is that, for the moment, the WHO is being punished for China's deceptions.",
        "document": "Much of what he said the U. N. health group did wrong. mirrors the president's own actions during that same time period. The National Security Council had intelligence by early January of a China outbreak that could threaten the United States, and by the end of the month, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro was warning of a pandemic that could kill up to half a million Americans. Yet for weeks, Trump dismissed concerns about the pandemic threat and didn't urge social distancing until the middle of March. Moreover, on Jan. 24, Trump tweeted praise for China's handling of the epidemic, including the nation's 'transparency,  adding, 'It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! \nTrump says the organization should have been more forthcoming, sounded the alarm louder, chastised and cajoled China into being better than it is. It's a big ask, one that even the world's most powerful nations and corporations shy away from in the face of Beijing's thin skin and economic might. 'Does the WHO play ball, so to speak, with China? Absolutely. The organization, for better or worse, is a deeply political body, not necessarily in its intent but in its functioning. It must operate across hundreds of member states, navigating complex political histories and allegiances to remain relevant but also reliable enough to get much-needed information. Without much tangible authority to punish, it must rely on prodding and pleasantries. Ironically, the actual solution to the WHO's shortcomings exposed by the pandemic is likely more authority, not less. More capacity, not less. But there's no political will for that, even now when the world's on fire.\nThe WHO has handled the coronavirus's emergence more nimbly than it did Ebola, reflecting the reforms made in the wake of that sluggish and inept response. But there is concern about the praise it has lavished on China and its leadership despite the anxieties over human rights, the length of time it took China to confirm human-to-human transmission and the cover-up of the scale and seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan by authorities, which allowed Covid-19's spread within China and abroad. The organisation has treated Taiwan appallingly, thanks to its concern for relations with Beijing. But suggesting that WHO officials are in thrall to China is a facile explanation. The WHO is a membership organisation, with responsibility but not power. It can try to steer member states, but has no sanctions; without sticks, it relies on carrots. It needs China's cooperation---not least because the precise origins of coronavirus within Wuhan remain unclear.\nMany Americans know nothing about the W. H. O. , but its worldwide budget (of which the United States pays about one-fifth) is less than that of some American hospital centers.

They each did something horrifically stupid and dangerous, echoing the worst of this country's racial history for their own selfish reasons. Cooper is a White woman who called the police on a Black birdwatcher in Central Park in May 2020, falsely reporting that he was threatening her life and that he had tried to assault her. 'Ultimately, I think it's a shame Smollett and Cooper have commanded so much of the public's attention and sparked so many arguments that I question whether we would all be better off if the actor's charges were dropped and the case was never revived. 'That's why I'm also unmoved by those criticizing people like Vice President Kamala Harris for immediately expressing shock and disgust when Smollett claimed he had been the victim of a violent attack. (Former President Donald Trump also responded to the attack in 2019 by calling it 'horrible,  before turning his ire on Smollett. ) Harris' sin, supposedly, was being too quick to believe a gay, Black man had suffered a racist and homophobic attack in a major American city, as though that's unimaginable.  Issac Bailey, CNN'According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, anti-LGBTQ organizations represented the fastest-growing sector of hate groups in 2019. LGBTQ people aren't just physically harmed by others. The torment we are confronted with living in a heterosexist society takes a toll on us mentally as well. A 2021 study by the Williams Institute, a sexual orientation and gender identity think tank at the UCLA School of Law, found that 30 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual respondents ages 18 to 25 reported at least one suicide attempt. 'Last week, ABC News affiliate WKRN reported that 12-year-old Eli Fritchley died by suicide in Tennessee. According to his parents, his classmates, other 11- and 12-year-olds, often told him he was 'going to go to hell' for being gay. anti-gay violence is real. Racist violence is real. We shouldn't let the hyped-up media circus that has surrounded this case from the beginning obscure that fact.\nI understand the anger against Smollett, because I held it too. When the story initially broke that he had been attacked, progressive politicians and celebrities alike rushed to social media to show support. When Smollett was arrested on suspicion of making it all up, it wasn't just that goodwill that was gone. A bit of media credibility went with it. 'The fine I am more than OK with, but at this point, why send him to jail? He's lost his hit show and career. He'll be mocked for this chapter, most likely for the rest of his life. It is a prison of a different sort. It is the prison in which the justice system decided to place former Rep. Aaron Schock. He had faced a 24-count indictment in 2016 alleging theft of government funds, filing false tax returns, filing false reports with federal election officials and wire fraud. But not long after Smollett was arrested in 2019, all of the charges against Schock were dropped by Chicago prosecutors under the conditions of good behavior and repaying the money.

A 2021 study by the Williams Institute, a sexual orientation and gender identity think tank at the UCLA School of Law, found that 30 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual respondents ages 18 to 25 reported at least one suicide attempt. 'Last week, ABC News affiliate WKRN reported that 12-year-old Eli Fritchley died by suicide in Tennessee. According to his parents, his classmates, other 11- and 12-year-olds, often told him he was 'going to go to hell' for being gay. anti-gay violence is real. Racist violence is real. We shouldn't let the hyped-up media circus that has surrounded this case from the beginning obscure that fact.\nI understand the anger against Smollett, because I held it too. When the story initially broke that he had been attacked, progressive politicians and celebrities alike rushed to social media to show support. When Smollett was arrested on suspicion of making it all up, it wasn't just that goodwill that was gone. A bit of media credibility went with it. 'The fine I am more than OK with, but at this point, why send him to jail? He's lost his hit show and career. He'll be mocked for this chapter, most likely for the rest of his life. It is a prison of a different sort. It is the prison in which the justice system decided to place former Rep. Aaron Schock. He had faced a 24-count indictment in 2016 alleging theft of government funds, filing false tax returns, filing false reports with federal election officials and wire fraud. But not long after Smollett was arrested in 2019, all of the charges against Schock were dropped by Chicago prosecutors under the conditions of good behavior and repaying the money. 'Now there are differences between the two cases, but the overall point is this: Jail isn't the only option our justice system uses to punish those who abuse the public's trust.\n\nRight:\nBad things happen every day in America, but the details of this story were really extraordinarily hard to believe, from the day he told it. Who beats up a guy without really beating him up? Who thinks Chicago is 'MAGA country'? What dudes roam Chicago with a noose and a bottle of bleach in the dead of winter hoping to run into a black guy so they can gently drape the noose around his neck and run away without so much as taking his cellphone? . 'Smollett is an exceptionally dumb guy who overloaded the fake attack with implausible details, and the everything-is-a-racial-emergency media ran with it. If you don't have a functioning bushwa detector, you simply shouldn't be in the media game. Nevertheless, almost across the board, the media reported it as a fact that Smollett 'was attacked,  or attributed this assertion to police, when it was never anything but a dubious assertion by an actor. Simple suggestion to everyone who promoted the hoax: Just say, 'I was wrong and I'm sorry.  It'll be good for you. It'll be good for America.\nPoliticians such as Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris all tweeted out their support of Smollett, some going as far as calling it a 'modern-day lynching'. It was egregious accusatory behavior, based on zero evidence. The biggest problem with the Jussie Smollett debacle is not that the media jumped headfirst into believing a tale that depicts Donald Trump and his supporters as red-hatted evil brownshirts---as with the case of Covington Catholic student Nicholas Sandmann. It's that they have failed to take responsibility or apologize for peddling false stories since.\nThe details of the Jussie Smollett case are as sensational as they are disturbing, but the bigger story is why a successful actor would invent such a racially-tinged plot out of whole cloth. The inconvenient truth is that his actions didn't spring from a vacuum. Far from it, our society actually incentivizes this kind of toxic behavior by glorifying victimhood. 'Smollett's story perfectly fit the media machine's pre-designed narrative: Trump and Republicans were racists and they were to blame for a stunning and violent hate-crime perpetrated against a young Black and gay actor. Jussie had every reason to believe that once he was cast as a victim, he would be hoisted upon shoulders and delivered to the next charmed phase of his career and life. From cries of racism at every turn, to the glorification by the media of victimhood mentality, Jussie Smollett is simply a result of a broken and dishonest media and political landscape.\nDuring the trial Smollett definitely seemed to be perjuring himself, as all of the evidence suggested. He lied to the jury just like he lied to Chicago police back in 2019. The court has two options if it wants to punish Smollett for giving false testimony. It can hold another trial, which would be costly and time-consuming. Or it can take into account Smollett's false testimony when it sentences him for five felony counts of disorderly conduct and add to the prison time he might serve. 'Smollett's sentencing has not yet been scheduled. But when he does appear in court again, he should be forced to learn what happens when you don't take the judicial process seriously.",

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nThe framers faced the same problem that has faced many republics in the past: balancing the need for widespread democratic access to political power, which helps to confer legitimacy, with the need for more narrow administration that frustrates and defeats the will of the people when the people have gone mad, as they do from time to time. What they came up with was a mix of democratic and anti-democratic institutions: in the legislative branch, a popularly elected House that serves as the accelerator and an appointed, quasi-aristocratic Senate that serves as the brakes. 'Democrats looking to eliminate the filibuster in 2021 should keep in mind that in January 2017 the elected branches of the federal government were under unified Republican control led by Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and Donald Trump, three representatives of the will of the people to whom Democrats very much wanted to say 'No. \nSupermajority rules are purposefully in place all throughout the U. S. government. They exist in the procedures to amend the constitution, overriding vetoes, and convicting presidents in an impeachment trial. The federal government, while slow and at times inefficient, is working as intended. Jefferson, fearing the possibility of a fast-paced federal government, penned a letter to James Madison saying 'I own I am not a friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive. . 'The opposition party being able to yell 'stop' at potentially harmful legislation is a critical part of the protection of minority rights. The filibuster protects the minority party and provides a much-needed check on government. It allows for our system of governance to be steadied, tending more towards federalism, allowing for compromise within the Capitol, and making discussion before passing critical legislation necessary.

That has come back to bite them as it opened the door for President Trump and Senate Republicans to streamline confirmation of judicial nomineesand to kill the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\nAmericans are generally not in favor of pure party-line votes. A pure partisan vote was a criticism of the vote to impeach President Trump and legislation passed during the first two years of Obama's presidency. Most Americans are also not comfortable with sweeping change. Incremental and consensus-based change is how our government has operated. If the filibuster is taken away, the Senate will become less deliberative. It will be a rubber stamp for the president's agenda when they are from the same party. It will become a barricade when they are from opposite parties.\nThe Hoover Institute's John Cochrane writes, 'Why are our politics so polarized? One answer is that elections are more and more winner take all. The more it is winner take all, the more incentive there is for scorched-earth tactics to win, or to keep from losing. The first function of a democracy is a peaceful transition of power. That requires losers to accept their fate, acknowledge the legitimacy of the outcome, regroup and try again. And they have to be able to do that. We are not a pure democracy. We are set up as a republic, with elaborate protections for electoral minorities. The point is to keep those electoral minorities from rebelling. Union first, 'progress' second.\n\nRight:\nIf a Republican minority blocks civil-rights legislation again in 2021, 'the pressure to get rid of the filibuster would be unbearable, and Democrats would have to get rid of it,  predicts Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff to Reid and the author of an upcoming book about the Senate, Kill Switch. Starting next year, Democrats 'simply could not explain' to their coalition and the broader public alike that they would fail 'to pass a new civil-rights agenda in deference to the procedural tool that was invented by segregationists to uphold Jim Crow and white supremacy. That is an unsustainable argument for Democrats to make. \nDemocrats would need to choose one of three paths. First, they could maintain the filibuster, giving Republicans the ability to block all significant legislation, while also retreating from the executive overreach that has defined the Trump years. This would result in a weak presidency and none of the progressive change Democrats long for. Second, they could maintain the filibuster, giving Republicans the ability to block all meaningful legislation, but continue the Trumpian executive overreach, allowing Biden to pursue progressive goals through regulation and executive orders. 'Third, they could abolish the filibuster, and use House and Senate majorities to pass as much progressive legislation as they can agree on. This would toss out a senatorial tradition but would strengthen Congress as a whole, and make it a more equal partner to the presidency. If you're Biden or Schumer, it's obvious which of these three choices will accomplish the most and undermine our political system least. If they get the chance, Senate Democrats should abolish the filibuster.\nThe filibuster is an accident of history. It came about only because when the Senate reorganized its rules in 1806, it accidentally deleted the clause allowing for debate to be ended by majority vote. It didn't even occur to anyone to try to halt legislation by endlessly talking for several more decades. For over a century afterwards, filibusters were primarily used by racists to stop civil rights legislation. Only during the Obama years did they become routine, with Republicans trying them on almost every piece of legislation (and now Democrats doing the same to Trump). Virtually every other legislative body in the world works by majority vote, and the Senate would be fine doing so as well.\nAngus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told The Hill that scrapping the filibuster 'would be a huge mistake.  After all, 'if we didn't have the 60-vote rule today, the ACA would be gone. . but It is not, in fact, true that the filibuster saved the Affordable Care Act. To the contrary, McConnell failed to get so much as 50 votes for a watered-down version of Obamacare repeal that would have left its Medicaid expansion intact. 'If Mitch McConnell believed that abolishing the filibuster was in the long-term best interest of his party and its donor class, ethical scruples would not have prevented him from scrapping it. The fact that the legislative filibuster remains in place---contrary to Donald Trump's wishes---reflects the GOP's awareness that the supermajority requirement favors conservatism.\nSome, however, note that 'Any Democrat tempted to destroy the legislative filibuster, should consider the cost of giving a future GOP majority the power to realize a right-wing agenda and control the federal budget without any input from the minority. Lasting major legislation like Social Security, Medicare, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Medicare prescription drugs, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and many others were accomplished with large Congressional majorities.

His vote and his behavior can't momentously hurt public policy. Walker's vote can, however, help block the worst of the Biden-Harris-Chuck Schumer excesses.\nWarnock will vote for every radical nominee Biden puts forward for the judiciary, the executive branch, or quasi-independent agencies. Walker won't. With Walker's vote, the Senate can still block the worst of the nominees if even one centrist Democrat, such as Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), decides Biden's choice is just too much to stomach.\nCentrist and independent Georgians who want to keep the government from making life worse, even if they aren't conservative, should want Walker, not Warnock, as their senator."

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nHow, exactly, did the Biden administration's critics think U. S. military involvement in Afghanistan was ever going to end? . Did you see the Taliban waiting patiently while the U. S. -trained Afghan army escorted U. S. citizens, other NATO nationals and our Afghan collaborators to the airport for evacuation? Did you imagine that the country's branch of the Islamic State would watch peacefully from the sidelines, or that regional warlords would renounce any hope of regaining their power, or that a nation with a centuries-old tradition of rejecting central authority would suddenly embrace it? . 'Should we have begun airlifting Afghan translators and others who helped the allied effort out of the country earlier, perhaps using the now-abandoned air base at Bagram as the departure gate? Maybe so, but such an evacuation might have created a panic---'The Americans are leaving! ---and a target both of the Taliban and ISIS. 'This is not an apologia for the tragic and chaotic scenes that have been unfolding in Kabul. Rather, it is a reality check. If there is a graceful, orderly way to abandon involvement in a brutal, unresolved civil war on the other side of the world, please cite historical precedents. I can't find them.\nThe administration has acknowledged that the Afghan government collapsed far faster than intelligence analysts and most military and diplomatic experts had anticipated. Fair enough. But the truth is that the Afghan government had itself urged against a mass evacuation, fearing that the sight of thousands of Afghans leaving on planes would undermine the already shaky confidence in the government of President Ashraf Ghani and his Western-backed forces. 'Our view is that every Afghan who worked with the US should be given support in leaving. That effort must not, and will not, end after Aug. 31. The U. S. has already pledged to get out every Afghan who has been granted a special immigrant visa. Because of unforgivable bureaucratic delays, not every deserving Afghan has been granted such a visa. But at this point, the Taliban is not allowing Afghans without paperwork to reach the Kabul airport. So staying at the airport beyond Tuesday would be futile. We support Biden's decision to withdraw U. S. forces from Afghanistan by Aug. 31, and his insistence on sticking to that deadline.\nCritics, however, argue that 'To leave now or on any imminent timetable would concede further public relations victories to ISIS-K. and to the Taliban as well. Although the Taliban and ISIS are not known to coordinate their efforts, and in fact have fought each other in the past, they share a common and publicly stated desire to drive the United States out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. 'The United States needs to rescue its people and close friends, demonstrate its resolve, and regain its foreign-policy footing after a catastrophic decision to leave made by the president. At a time of fear and uncertainty, we need to keep those core goals in mind. remaining for at least another month can constitute real leverage. 'Michael O'Hanlon, USA Today\nIn time, Biden will doubtlessly find someone to punish. Too much has gone wrong to leave voters with the impression that there wasn't any accountability. But demoting or disempowering or reassigning someone immediately only obscures the uncomfortable reality that mistakes in Afghanistan spanned four presidencies, resulting in lives needlessly lost and taxpayer money inexcusably wasted.\n\nRight:\nEven after the collapse of the Afghan military, Mr. Biden could have introduced enough force to retake the large Bagram air base, which is further from Kabul and has two runways and a larger security perimeter. or he could have provided more force protection for the Kabul airport. 'Mr. Biden has said over the last two weeks that he chose to withdraw from Afghanistan to avoid more casualties. Yet the 13 American deaths12 Marines and a Navy medicare more American deaths in Afghanistan than in all of 2020 when thousands of U. S. troops were in the country advising Afghan forces. By one count they are the most U. S. troops killed in a day since 2011. The Kabul airport massacre compounds the humiliation of the botched Afghan withdrawal and will further embolden jihadists.\nThe execution of this operation has been plagued by organizational and bureaucratic screwups that are either laughable or horrifying: the State Department advertised job openings in Kabul just before the evacuation, and the U. S. military handed safe-passage lists of Afghan allies to the Taliban, to name just two examples. 'The execution of a policy that Biden supported for years looks like a complete improvisation by a national-security bureaucracy that wanted to pretend it had no idea Biden would make this decision.

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nThe program requires 'a valid passport, a plane ticket, the ability and permission to travel to the US by plane, a US-based sponsor, a cell phone that can download a specific app that requires two-factor authentication, and a host of other requirements.\nThis is a program obviously designed to favor those with means and pre-established connections in the US, and it's hard to imagine it as anything but meaningless for those forced to flee for their lives without money or planning. As Human Rights Watch explains, Biden's proposed program is 'contrary to international refugee law and international human rights law which prohibits discrimination in accessing asylum, including based on financial means'.\nThere's no question that the current situation presents all kinds of challenges at the border. The US government recorded almost 2. 4m encounters with migrants at the border last fiscal year, a record number. But it's also clear that Biden feels compelled to get in front of the border issue ahead of Republican fearmongering. The new rules seem devised more to quell Republican objections (which, let's face it, can never be mollified) rather than to take humanitarian and legal concerns to heart and turn them into workable policy.\nBiden pitched his border plan as a way to bring order to chaos, with between 7, 500 to 8, 000 refugees crossing the U. S. -Mexico border every day in December. The wealthiest country in the world could respond to this mass movement by working with direct service providers on the ground and providing sufficient resources to swiftly resettle those fleeing political turmoil---turmoil for which the U. S. carries significant historic responsibility. Instead, the burden of this order is being placed on those fleeing for their own survival.\nOthers argue, 'Biden's statement on Thursday drew angry criticism from Democratic activists. An immigration advocate called his new border policy 'callous.  A human rights leader described it as 'a humanitarian disgrace.  The critics seemed to imply that the very idea of border control is morally wrong. This progressive view is compassionate but misconceived. Border security can be abused, but it's an essential requirement for a free, sovereign nation.\nIn politics, you usually get credit for telling the faithful what they want to hear.

The workers who rejected the deal cited paid sick leave, but the deal includes a new day of unscheduled sick leave on top of existing railroad policies that grant an average three weeks of vacation and paid sick leave starting as soon as after four sick days. A vote to enact a labor deal should be easy if legislators want to keep the U. S. economy running.\nIn September, Biden gloated about how the deal he'd secured then proved wrong those who doubted he could head off a strike. Oops: Looks like it didn't. But it did score points for Democrats, delaying potential labor action until after the midterms (though perhaps inviting the unions to demand even more). . .\nSo now Union Joe has suddenly become Union-Buster-in-Chief, asking Congress to force a deal on workers, and to hell with their 'choices.  It's the correct move: No one wants a rail strike to nuke an already ailing US economy. But it sure would be nice if the prez finally understood that everyday businesses, taxpayers and consumers are also sometimes threatened by greedy unions---and that disputes between management and workers should generally be left to themselves, without Uncle Sam's thumb on the scale.\nPassing this before the weekend may be easier said than done---and not just in the Senate, either. Schumer gave Mitch McConnell credit for supporting the deal and the bill imposing it, but neither man can be assured of enough votes to succeed. Bernie Sanders has already balked at the terms of this deal, repeatedly and publicly, and Sanders carries a lot of weight among Senate progressives. Marco Rubio staked out the working-class hero position in McConnell's caucus, and won't be the last to do so. It will take 60 votes at some point to get this bill passed.\nIf I had to place a bet, I'd guess on some sort of deal that gets a bill passed by Friday afternoon. But Pelosi, Schumer, and Biden will have to cough up some concessions to make it work---not for workers, but for Republicans. Perhaps an agreement to adjourn after passing an omnibus for the remainder of the fiscal year would do it, shutting down the lame-duck session before Pelosi and Schumer can conduct any more mischief.\n\nRight:\nMore than one hundred thousand workers employed at America's railways do not currently receive paid sick days and face strict and punitive attendance policies that leave many with no weekends and little time off. At the Warren Buffettowned BNSF, for example, workers are allotted a point balance that diminishes if they're unavailable for work---even in cases of illness or emergency. Those who reach a balance of zero can incur a ten- or twenty-day suspension, with a subsequent zero balance resulting in termination.\nMany are expected to be on call more or less around the clock and can be required to report for shifts of nearly eighty hours on only ninety minutes' notice. Shareholders, meanwhile, have received bigger and bigger payouts.\nProviding 15 days of paid sick leave would cost the industry roughly $688 million per year, according to the rail companies. But with railroad profit margins at record highs, this cost would hardly harm profitability. BNSF, one of the largest railroad freight carriers, saw its net income climb four percent to $4. 5 billion in the first nine months of this year. Last year, the railway raked in $6 billion in profits, a 16% jump from the year prior.\nSimilarly, Union Pacific, the largest railroad in the U. S. , said it had its 'most profitable year ever in 2021,  reporting $6. 5 billion in profits. Compared to 2000, the railway today employs 18, 000 fewer workers but makes 85% more in revenue. Since 2021, the company has also spent nearly $13 billion repurchasing its own stock---enriching Union Pacific executives at the expense of their workers.\nThe irony of this whole fiasco is that the critical nature of railroad workers is exactly why their rights as workers are so neutered, even as the freight rail industry is flushed with cash. Due to the Railway Labor Act, workers cannot freely engage in collective bargaining for their jobs, and often must accept whatever scraps the dominant corporations offer. However, while the law presents the problem, Congress must act to pass the resolution and the president must sign it. So the choice is in the hands of the current Democratic majority.\nIn response to industry's request for congressional intervention, SMART-TD president Jeremy Ferguson said: 'This can all be settled through negotiations and without a strike.

'An insurrectionist showing off the makeshift noose and gallows he made outside the Capitol, where Confederate flags and Trump banners flew. Retreating officers, overrun, being taunted by the invaders: 'There's a f---ing million of us out there. And we are listening to Trump---your boss. . 'It was reported that several of Trump's fiercest defenders in the Senate didn't watch the video Raskin played. They could avert their gaze, but could they shut their ears to the bloodcurdling shouts and chants of the mob as they rampaged through the seat of American democracy?\nTrump's speech on January 6th seems to lend permission to his supporters to do whatever is necessary to stop the election theft. 'You can't vote on fraud and fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it?  Trump said. 'When you catch somebody in fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.  He then urges Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally declare that the election had been fraudulent and so Trump should be the victor.

He again tells the crowd that 'we're going to the Capitol' to give 'weak Republicans. the pride and boldness they need to take back our country. \nTrump's lawyers argue in their filings that because Trump called upon supporters to 'peacefully' make their voices heard, this negates his other exhortations to lawlessness. Trump had for weeks been encouraging supporters to arrive at the Capitol on January 6, tweeting 'Be there, will be wild!  Trump's isolated request for peacefulness cannot un-ring the bell. 'The insurrectionists themselves have told law enforcement officers that they were 'merely following the directions of then-President Trump,  as did a man accused of discharging a fire extinguisher at police. 'Trump's defense will argue that Trump's exhortations were not, in fact, calling for actual lawlessness. They were figures of speech.

With the government controlling access to healthcare, they would also control the distribution of healthcare. In socialized healthcare systems, with supposedly universal access, it is not uncommon for patients to wait months (if not years) for treatment. patients even die on these waiting lists.\nIn Canada, 'the median wait for treatment from a specialist following referral by a general practitioner is 19. 8 weeks. In 1993 before the current system was implemented, the median wait was less than half as much---9. 3 weeks. Waits are far longer for some specialties.

In contrast, 95 percent of these drugs are available today in the U. S. For patients, this choice matters. It's why the United States has the highest five-year survival rate for cancers in the world.\nTalk about ditching private health insurance may be the kind of thing that does well in super-liberal circles, and being super liberal may seem to be the kind of thing that gets you a decent cult following and a lot of media coverage. but the truth is, for a lot of Americans, the thought of making our system into a socialized one is still scary.\n\nRight:\nYale professor Jacob Hacker states, 'We have a system that is truly distinctive in advanced democracies and distinctively poorly performing. We spend more than other countries. We don't do a lot better or sometimes we do worse on health outcomes and we don't cover everyone even after the Affordable Care Act. Even 15 years ago, there were a lot of people saying we have the best health care in the world and you didn't want to screw that up by getting government too involved. But it's almost impossible to sustain that argument today.\nMany note that 'there are a slew of bills, introduced or suggested by other members of Congress and influential think tanks like the Center for American Progress, which use the language of Medicare for All but advocate for wildly different policies. They include three separate Medicare buy-in bills, a Medicaid buy-in bill, and CAP's 'Medicare for All' bill, among others. The diversity of approacheshas created ambiguity that politicians don't seem particularly eager to clear up---'Medicare for All' is a galvanizing rallying cry.\nThe thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se. They want universal, affordable coverage that doesn't leave them begging on GoFundMe for their kids' insulin. And purity tests aside, there are many ways to achieve that outcome. These include allowing non-elderly adults to buy into Medicare. allowing employers to purchase Medicare for workers; a Medicaid buy-in program; and enrolling all newborns in a government health plan.\nThose in favor of universal healthcare posit that 'you have to compare what a universal system would cost to what we're paying now. 'Last year we collectively spent about $3. 5 trillion on health care, and under current projections, if we keep the system as it is now, we'll spend $50 trillion over the next decade. you can criticize any particular universal plan on any number of grounds. But if it costs less than $50 trillion over 10 years---which every universal plan does---you can't say it's 'unaffordable' or it would 'bankrupt' us, because the truth is just the opposite.\nThose in favor of incremental reforms note that 'during the ACA debate, Republicans failed to recognize the degree to which their traditional priority of minimizing government involvement in health care could threaten the financial security of the older and working-class whites now central to their electoral fortunes. Similarly, Democrats may be underestimating how much of their new coalitionwhich increasingly relies on well-educated whites in major metropolitan areasmay resist entrusting the health-care system entirely to government control.\nFinally, 'process matters. Absent a plan to get rid of the filibuster, or absent a bill that can fit entirely inside the budget reconciliation process, all of this is moot. In that world, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown's plan to open Medicare to the 55-to-64 set is probably the best you can do. 'The history of health care reform is mostly a history of failure and backlash. That's because America's political institutions make big bills hard to pass, because moneyed interests fight like hell against its passage, and because people don't trust the government to mess with their health care. How the various Democrats running for president propose to navigate or defuse those threats should be integral to this debate.",

The diversity of approacheshas created ambiguity that politicians don't seem particularly eager to clear up---'Medicare for All' is a galvanizing rallying cry.\nThe thing Americans want most, if you look at the polling, is not single-payer per se.

These include allowing non-elderly adults to buy into Medicare. allowing employers to purchase Medicare for workers; a Medicaid buy-in program; and enrolling all newborns in a government health plan.\nThose in favor of universal healthcare posit that 'you have to compare what a universal system would cost to what we're paying now. 'Last year we collectively spent about $3. 5 trillion on health care, and under current projections, if we keep the system as it is now, we'll spend $50 trillion over the next decade. you can criticize any particular universal plan on any number of grounds. But if it costs less than $50 trillion over 10 years---which every universal plan does---you can't say it's 'unaffordable' or it would 'bankrupt' us, because the truth is just the opposite.\nThose in favor of incremental reforms note that 'during the ACA debate, Republicans failed to recognize the degree to which their traditional priority of minimizing government involvement in health care could threaten the financial security of the older and working-class whites now central to their electoral fortunes. Similarly, Democrats may be underestimating how much of their new coalitionwhich increasingly relies on well-educated whites in major metropolitan areasmay resist entrusting the health-care system entirely to government control.\nFinally, 'process matters. Absent a plan to get rid of the filibuster, or absent a bill that can fit entirely inside the budget reconciliation process, all of this is moot. In that world, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown's plan to open Medicare to the 55-to-64 set is probably the best you can do. 'The history of health care reform is mostly a history of failure and backlash. That's because America's political institutions make big bills hard to pass, because moneyed interests fight like hell against its passage, and because people don't trust the government to mess with their health care. How the various Democrats running for president propose to navigate or defuse those threats should be integral to this debate.\n\nRight:\nThe most comprehensive cost analysis of the Medicare for All bill estimated that the legislation would cost $32. 6 trillion over its first decade. This estimate. assumes that physicians and hospitals would take home a reimbursement rate 40 percent lower than private insurance. One of two things would happen as a result. Physicians could play hardball with the government and demand more pay, thus blowing out that $32. 6 trillion figure. Or, more realistically, there would be a mass exodus of providers from the market. 'Moreover we're the single most charitable nation in the world, with $33 billion going to health organizations and $22 billion going to international affairs. If you think that would continue with a socialized system---our boots-on-the-ground medical initiatives in the developing world and life-saving treatments distributed globally---do I have a bridge to sell you.\nWhile the left often criticizes the disconnect between the United States and other industrialized nations in providing health care, those champions of medical equity nearly never mention the taxes necessary for getting there. American politicians have not suggested revising our tax structure to mirror any in Europe. Instead, they wave off the costs as something 'the rich' will pay for, which is mathematically impossible.\nCurrently, the quality of care received in the United States is limited only by your wallet. While this may seem unfair to some, your choice remains free from government interference. With the government controlling access to healthcare, they would also control the distribution of healthcare. In socialized healthcare systems, with supposedly universal access, it is not uncommon for patients to wait months (if not years) for treatment. patients even die on these waiting lists.\nIn Canada, 'the median wait for treatment from a specialist following referral by a general practitioner is 19. 8 weeks. In 1993 before the current system was implemented, the median wait was less than half as much---9. 3 weeks. Waits are far longer for some specialties. For orthopedic surgery, the median wait for specialist treatment is 39 weeks.\nIn the US, primary care physicians already spend 'up to twice as much time on their computers as they do with their patients, and a majority of physicians feel they are working at or beyond their capacity. there's little to suggest that increasing government involvement would streamline health care delivery. outdated documentation requirements in the form of the evaluation and management codesa major factor in an administrative burden that has been in place since 1995are a requirement set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nMany also note that 'Medicare for all would reduce access to needed, cutting-edge drugs. in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Greece, only 74 percent, 49 percent, and 8 percent, respectively, of cancer drugs launched between 2011 and 2018 are available. In contrast, 95 percent of these drugs are available today in the U. S. For patients, this choice matters. It's why the United States has the highest five-year survival rate for cancers in the world.\nTalk about ditching private health insurance may be the kind of thing that does well in super-liberal circles, and being super liberal may seem to be the kind of thing that gets you a decent cult following and a lot of media coverage. but the truth is, for a lot of Americans, the thought of making our system into a socialized one is still scary.",
        "document": "Yale professor Jacob Hacker states, 'We have a system that is truly distinctive in advanced democracies and distinctively poorly performing. We spend more than other countries. We don't do a lot better or sometimes we do worse on health outcomes and we don't cover everyone even after the Affordable Care Act. Even 15 years ago, there were a lot of people saying we have the best health care in the world and you didn't want to screw that up by getting government too involved. But it's almost impossible to sustain that argument today.\nMany note that 'there are a slew of bills, introduced or suggested by other members of Congress and influential think tanks like the Center for American Progress, which use the language of Medicare for All but advocate for wildly different policies.

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) is expected to certify the statewide result Friday, as required by law. The certification then goes to Gov. Brian Kemp, another Republican, for his signature. Kemp told reporters last week that he was glad Raffensperger ordered the hand-counted audit of the presidential vote. 'Let's let that happen and let the chips fall where they may,  he said. Yet Trump has for the past several days been publicly badgering Kemp to intervene in the recount to reject ballots and 'flip' the result, which currently has Biden winning by 12, 284 votes. 'Republicans must get tough!  Trump tweeted at Kemp on Thursday morning. 'The president earlier this week called a Republican member of Wayne County's Board of Canvassers, after which she attempted to rescind her vote to certify Biden's win in Wayne, which is where Detroit is located and is the state's most populous county. Trump then invited the leaders of Michigan's Republican-controlled state Senate and House to meet him Friday at the White House ahead of next Monday's state canvassing board meeting to certify results. 'Trump also is consulting with advisers about how he might get Wisconsin ballots discarded. These are the words and actions of an attempted coup, according to historians and other experts.\nPalmer and Hartmann's stated reason for wanting to rescind their certification of the election results in Wayne County was that there were discrepancies between precincts' counts of how many named people voted and the actual count of votes. This is known as precincts being 'out of balance.  But though many precincts were out of balance, the discrepancies were usually very small. 'Most of the unbalanced Wayne County precincts reported to the board Tuesday were off by three or four votes,  Zahra Ahmad and Lauren Gibbons of MLive reported. Small mistakes like that suggest clerical error rather than a massive fraud scheme---and certainly they don't add up to anything close to Biden's lead in the state. 'It was lost on few that the two Republicans who voted against certification are white and were alleging problems in the mostly Black city of Detroit. Indeed, Palmer even suggested that all of Wayne County's results except for Detroit could be certified---even though the most out-of-balance precinct, with a 27-vote discrepancy, was in the mostly white city of Livonia.\nBaseless claims about mass voter fraud were thrown out of a Michigan court last week, when a judge blocked Trump's attempt to stop certification of Biden's win by declaring accusations of widespread election fraud 'incorrect and not credible.  Not deterred by legal reasoning, facts or judicial decisions, Trump simply blurted out fantasies of a Michigan victory, declaring on Wednesday: 'The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN! . 'President Trump further highlighted his autocratic impulses by firing his director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Chris Krebs, for the sin of doing his job and telling the truth, when he said 'there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.  Trump's baseless and failed legal claims of mass voter fraud depend on denying that reality. As a result, telling the truth is a firing offense. None of this is normal or consistent with the character of our democracy. When Trump carried Michigan in 2016 by just over 10, 000 votes, there was not this kind of skullduggery by Democrats. There certainly should not be with a Biden vote total 14 times larger.\nAppearing in a Pennsylvania courtroom Tuesday in the state's biggest case, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani conceded, 'This is not a fraud case.  In the same case, a judge asked Trump lawyer Linda Kerns whether she would 'agree with me that you are not proceeding based on allegations of fraud or misconduct; is that correct?  Kerns responded, 'I am not proceeding on those allegations.  In Montgomery County, Pa. , Trump lawyer Jonathan S. Goldstein was asked by a judge, 'Are you claiming that there is any fraud in connection with these 592 disputed ballots?  Goldstein responded: 'To my knowledge at present, no. . 'In Maricopa County, Ariz. , home to Phoenix, Trump lawyer Kory Langhofer said, 'We are not alleging fraud in this lawsuit. . This is not about fraud. . In the joint stipulation in Bucks County, the Trump legal team conceded, 'Petitioners do not allege, and there is no evidence, that any of the challenged ballots were cast by, or on behalf of, a deceased person. . Trump's own lawyers keep undermining his voter fraud claims.\nGiuliani claimed that he had more than 100 affidavits alleging voting improprieties in a federal lawsuit the campaign filed in Michigan, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Benson. But the campaign's own lawyers voluntarily dismissed that suit just hours before Mr. Giuliani held his news conference. Mr. Giuliani further said that the Trump campaign had affidavits proving that nearly 700, 000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania had been tainted. But no such affidavits have been filed in the campaign's federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania that is seeking to halt the certification of the vote there. 'Sidney Powell, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, baselessly warned of 'massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China and the interference with our elections here in the United States.  She claimed that tabulating software used by Dominion and Smartmatic, two voting machine companies, was 'created by Hugo Chavez. . The Trump campaign has not yet included allegations about Dominion machines in any of its more than 30 lawsuits where the accusations would have to be proven in front of a judge.\nThe longer the presser went on, the more it became clear that the Trump campaign was relying not so much on affidavits of misconduct or statistical demonstrations of altered results but rather the broadest sorts of conspiracy theories, most of them inherently absurd or previously exploded. 'Giuliani repeatedly spoke of mail ballots as though they are some sort of sinister new invention rather than a method of voting that has been available in one form or another in every state for years. He also with a straight face argued that the reversal of early Trump leads in many states as mail ballots were counted was prima facie evidence of fraud, rather than a reflection of his own client's loud, constant, and successful efforts to convince Republicans not to vote by mail---and of Republican legislators' decision to ban the counting of mail ballots until Election Day or immediately before it.\n\nRight:\nThe margin of victory in this race is at least 44, 872 votes across three states (Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia). Fraud on that scale across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously is mind-bogglingly difficult to pull off without leaving significant footprints. The 1982 Illinois governor's race---almost stolen by Democrats by virtue of 100, 000 fraudulent votes in Chicago---was still concentrated in a single city with a well-oiled machine with many decades of experience in such shenanigans. It was still not truly that well-hidden. 'And yet, this supposed fraud in 2020 failed to save numerous Democrats below the presidential level. In Arizona, for example, you can complain about the Democrat who serves as Maricopa County recorder, but if he was in on the fix, you might also ask why he lost his own reelection race. In Pennsylvania, Democrats lost two out of the three statewide races, both by agonizingly small margins. 'In Georgia, the Republican secretary of state fought to ensure a hand recount and other protections for the integrity of this election; it does not seem likely that he and his predecessor, the state's Republican governor (Brian Kemp, a longtime hate figure on the left), are in on the conspiracy. The reality is that Joe Biden will be sworn in on January 20, and nothing anybody does can prevent that. Our job is to plan for what comes next.\nGiven how close the election was in key battlegrounds, and how the vote count shifted against Trump after election night, it was inevitable Republicans would have suspicions about the process. But it's wrong for Trump to fuel the doubts with a constant flow of bad information and conspiracy theories---just as elected Democrats and the media never should have played up the cockamamie idea that the Russians stole the election in 2016. 'In Wayne County, the discrepancies that motivated the GOP canvassers were vanishingly small. According to The Detroit Free Press, the majority of Election Day precincts and absent voter boards with mismatches had discrepancies of three or fewer votes, amounting to roughly 387 votes. Trump lost Michigan by about 150, 000 votes---and slightly overperformed in Wayne County. 'The slogan of counting every 'legal vote' is a safe harbor that all Republicans can hew to, but it should go without saying that it must mean counting---and certifying---valid votes for Joe Biden.\nFor more than a week, Trump lawyer Sidney Powell has been all over conservative media with the following story: This election was stolen by a collection of international leftists who manipulated vote tabulating software in order to flip millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. 'But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of polite requests. When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her. When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they also told us Powell had never given them any evidence to prove anything she claimed today at the press conference. Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous, and she's right, but she never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another. Not one. 'Why are we telling you this? We're telling you this because it's true, and in the end, that's all that matters. The truth is our only hope and our best defense. Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details on exactly how this happened and precisely who did it. We are certainly hopeful that she will. What happened with the vote counting this month and at the polling places in Detroit and the polling places in Philadelphia and so much else actually matters. It matters no matter who you voted for.\nBefore all else, we must go to the source of distrust over this election. Whereas Florida finished counting votes on election night, and has a system that knows roughly how many votes are outstanding and will be counted before election night is over, in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin an unknown number of ballots could come in at the last second. And they did. For that, thank Democrat lawsuits to overturn state voting laws at the last second, using COVID as a pretext. For those who doubt that the suits were nakedly political, note that they looked like a wish list based on a bill Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi authored in 2019 to accomplish nationwide mail-in voting. 'Regardless of the existence or level of fraud in the 2020 election, it is a fact that mail-in balloting opens elections to the likelihood of massive fraud and chaos. First, there's an easy opportunity for cheating, given the unknown number of ballots that can come in. Because ballots can be accepted after election day, an unscrupulous faction that lags in earlier counting can come up with the votes to make the difference. 'The obvious problems with mail-in voting are not a rightwing conspiracy. France banned mail-in voting in the 1970s for these very reasons. In a recent New Jersey mail-in election, about 20 percent of the ballots cast were found to be fraudulent. A local New York election this year saw huge delays in processing ballots. A 2012 article in the New York Times warns that regular old absentee voting could screw up the electoral process, let alone allowing ballots to come in after election day.\nSuccessful vote-by-mail requires secure ballot returns with strict and bipartisan chains of custody. In Colorado each county has drop boxes and statute mandates that they are lit, locked, and monitored 24/7 by camera surveillance. Moreover, in Colorado, a bipartisan team of election judges collects ballots and takes them to counting rooms with additional cameras and bipartisan teams of judges. Every step of the way includes surveillance and bipartisan judges who have passed criminal background checks, ensuring a consistent chain of custody. Colorado voters can also track their ballot online throughout its life cycle. The parties appoint the election judges to guarantee authentic representation. 'Voters in other states are right to be skeptical of drop boxes and to ask officials if theirs had 24/7 video surveillance and if ballots were picked up with bipartisan judges. Vote-by-mail must also include a robust signature verification system. In Pennsylvania, the Democrat majority of the state's partisan-elected Supreme Court threw out signature verification requirements for mail-ballots only. States that expanded vote-by-mail had a duty to ensure proper controls and safeguards to catch corrupt acts and real mistakes when they happened. Those states that did not do an adequate job ought to concern every American, regardless of party.",

The certification then goes to Gov. Brian Kemp, another Republican, for his signature. Kemp told reporters last week that he was glad Raffensperger ordered the hand-counted audit of the presidential vote. 'Let's let that happen and let the chips fall where they may,  he said. Yet Trump has for the past several days been publicly badgering Kemp to intervene in the recount to reject ballots and 'flip' the result, which currently has Biden winning by 12, 284 votes. 'Republicans must get tough!  Trump tweeted at Kemp on Thursday morning. 'The president earlier this week called a Republican member of Wayne County's Board of Canvassers, after which she attempted to rescind her vote to certify Biden's win in Wayne, which is where Detroit is located and is the state's most populous county. Trump then invited the leaders of Michigan's Republican-controlled state Senate and House to meet him Friday at the White House ahead of next Monday's state canvassing board meeting to certify results. 'Trump also is consulting with advisers about how he might get Wisconsin ballots discarded. These are the words and actions of an attempted coup, according to historians and other experts.\nPalmer and Hartmann's stated reason for wanting to rescind their certification of the election results in Wayne County was that there were discrepancies between precincts' counts of how many named people voted and the actual count of votes. This is known as precincts being 'out of balance.  But though many precincts were out of balance, the discrepancies were usually very small. 'Most of the unbalanced Wayne County precincts reported to the board Tuesday were off by three or four votes,  Zahra Ahmad and Lauren Gibbons of MLive reported. Small mistakes like that suggest clerical error rather than a massive fraud scheme---and certainly they don't add up to anything close to Biden's lead in the state. 'It was lost on few that the two Republicans who voted against certification are white and were alleging problems in the mostly Black city of Detroit. Indeed, Palmer even suggested that all of Wayne County's results except for Detroit could be certified---even though the most out-of-balance precinct, with a 27-vote discrepancy, was in the mostly white city of Livonia.\nBaseless claims about mass voter fraud were thrown out of a Michigan court last week, when a judge blocked Trump's attempt to stop certification of Biden's win by declaring accusations of widespread election fraud 'incorrect and not credible.  Not deterred by legal reasoning, facts or judicial decisions, Trump simply blurted out fantasies of a Michigan victory, declaring on Wednesday: 'The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN! . 'President Trump further highlighted his autocratic impulses by firing his director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Chris Krebs, for the sin of doing his job and telling the truth, when he said 'there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.  Trump's baseless and failed legal claims of mass voter fraud depend on denying that reality. As a result, telling the truth is a firing offense. None of this is normal or consistent with the character of our democracy. When Trump carried Michigan in 2016 by just over 10, 000 votes, there was not this kind of skullduggery by Democrats. There certainly should not be with a Biden vote total 14 times larger.\nAppearing in a Pennsylvania courtroom Tuesday in the state's biggest case, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani conceded, 'This is not a fraud case.  In the same case, a judge asked Trump lawyer Linda Kerns whether she would 'agree with me that you are not proceeding based on allegations of fraud or misconduct; is that correct?  Kerns responded, 'I am not proceeding on those allegations.  In Montgomery County, Pa. , Trump lawyer Jonathan S. Goldstein was asked by a judge, 'Are you claiming that there is any fraud in connection with these 592 disputed ballots?  Goldstein responded: 'To my knowledge at present, no. . 'In Maricopa County, Ariz. , home to Phoenix, Trump lawyer Kory Langhofer said, 'We are not alleging fraud in this lawsuit. . This is not about fraud. . In the joint stipulation in Bucks County, the Trump legal team conceded, 'Petitioners do not allege, and there is no evidence, that any of the challenged ballots were cast by, or on behalf of, a deceased person. . Trump's own lawyers keep undermining his voter fraud claims.\nGiuliani claimed that he had more than 100 affidavits alleging voting improprieties in a federal lawsuit the campaign filed in Michigan, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. v. Benson. But the campaign's own lawyers voluntarily dismissed that suit just hours before Mr. Giuliani held his news conference. Mr. Giuliani further said that the Trump campaign had affidavits proving that nearly 700, 000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania had been tainted. But no such affidavits have been filed in the campaign's federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania that is seeking to halt the certification of the vote there. 'Sidney Powell, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, baselessly warned of 'massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China and the interference with our elections here in the United States.  She claimed that tabulating software used by Dominion and Smartmatic, two voting machine companies, was 'created by Hugo Chavez. . The Trump campaign has not yet included allegations about Dominion machines in any of its more than 30 lawsuits where the accusations would have to be proven in front of a judge.\nThe longer the presser went on, the more it became clear that the Trump campaign was relying not so much on affidavits of misconduct or statistical demonstrations of altered results but rather the broadest sorts of conspiracy theories, most of them inherently absurd or previously exploded. 'Giuliani repeatedly spoke of mail ballots as though they are some sort of sinister new invention rather than a method of voting that has been available in one form or another in every state for years. He also with a straight face argued that the reversal of early Trump leads in many states as mail ballots were counted was prima facie evidence of fraud, rather than a reflection of his own client's loud, constant, and successful efforts to convince Republicans not to vote by mail---and of Republican legislators' decision to ban the counting of mail ballots until Election Day or immediately before it.",
        "document": "The margin of victory in this race is at least 44, 872 votes across three states (Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia). Fraud on that scale across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously is mind-bogglingly difficult to pull off without leaving significant footprints. The 1982 Illinois governor's race---almost stolen by Democrats by virtue of 100, 000 fraudulent votes in Chicago---was still concentrated in a single city with a well-oiled machine with many decades of experience in such shenanigans. It was still not truly that well-hidden. 'And yet, this supposed fraud in 2020 failed to save numerous Democrats below the presidential level. In Arizona, for example, you can complain about the Democrat who serves as Maricopa County recorder, but if he was in on the fix, you might also ask why he lost his own reelection race. In Pennsylvania, Democrats lost two out of the three statewide races, both by agonizingly small margins. 'In Georgia, the Republican secretary of state fought to ensure a hand recount and other protections for the integrity of this election; it does not seem likely that he and his predecessor, the state's Republican governor (Brian Kemp, a longtime hate figure on the left), are in on the conspiracy. The reality is that Joe Biden will be sworn in on January 20, and nothing anybody does can prevent that. Our job is to plan for what comes next.\nGiven how close the election was in key battlegrounds, and how the vote count shifted against Trump after election night, it was inevitable Republicans would have suspicions about the process. But it's wrong for Trump to fuel the doubts with a constant flow of bad information and conspiracy theories---just as elected Democrats and the media never should have played up the cockamamie idea that the Russians stole the election in 2016. 'In Wayne County, the discrepancies that motivated the GOP canvassers were vanishingly small. According to The Detroit Free Press, the majority of Election Day precincts and absent voter boards with mismatches had discrepancies of three or fewer votes, amounting to roughly 387 votes. Trump lost Michigan by about 150, 000 votes---and slightly overperformed in Wayne County. 'The slogan of counting every 'legal vote' is a safe harbor that all Republicans can hew to, but it should go without saying that it must mean counting---and certifying---valid votes for Joe Biden.\nFor more than a week, Trump lawyer Sidney Powell has been all over conservative media with the following story: This election was stolen by a collection of international leftists who manipulated vote tabulating software in order to flip millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. 'But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of polite requests. When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her. When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they also told us Powell had never given them any evidence to prove anything she claimed today at the press conference. Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous, and she's right, but she never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another. Not one. 'Why are we telling you this? We're telling you this because it's true, and in the end, that's all that matters. The truth is our only hope and our best defense. Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details on exactly how this happened and precisely who did it. We are certainly hopeful that she will. What happened with the vote counting this month and at the polling places in Detroit and the polling places in Philadelphia and so much else actually matters. It matters no matter who you voted for.\nBefore all else, we must go to the source of distrust over this election. Whereas Florida finished counting votes on election night, and has a system that knows roughly how many votes are outstanding and will be counted before election night is over, in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin an unknown number of ballots could come in at the last second. And they did. For that, thank Democrat lawsuits to overturn state voting laws at the last second, using COVID as a pretext. For those who doubt that the suits were nakedly political, note that they looked like a wish list based on a bill Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi authored in 2019 to accomplish nationwide mail-in voting. 'Regardless of the existence or level of fraud in the 2020 election, it is a fact that mail-in balloting opens elections to the likelihood of massive fraud and chaos. First, there's an easy opportunity for cheating, given the unknown number of ballots that can come in. Because ballots can be accepted after election day, an unscrupulous faction that lags in earlier counting can come up with the votes to make the difference. 'The obvious problems with mail-in voting are not a rightwing conspiracy. France banned mail-in voting in the 1970s for these very reasons. In a recent New Jersey mail-in election, about 20 percent of the ballots cast were found to be fraudulent. A local New York election this year saw huge delays in processing ballots. A 2012 article in the New York Times warns that regular old absentee voting could screw up the electoral process, let alone allowing ballots to come in after election day.\nSuccessful vote-by-mail requires secure ballot returns with strict and bipartisan chains of custody. In Colorado each county has drop boxes and statute mandates that they are lit, locked, and monitored 24/7 by camera surveillance. Moreover, in Colorado, a bipartisan team of election judges collects ballots and takes them to counting rooms with additional cameras and bipartisan teams of judges. Every step of the way includes surveillance and bipartisan judges who have passed criminal background checks, ensuring a consistent chain of custody. Colorado voters can also track their ballot online throughout its life cycle. The parties appoint the election judges to guarantee authentic representation. 'Voters in other states are right to be skeptical of drop boxes and to ask officials if theirs had 24/7 video surveillance and if ballots were picked up with bipartisan judges. Vote-by-mail must also include a robust signature verification system. In Pennsylvania, the Democrat majority of the state's partisan-elected Supreme Court threw out signature verification requirements for mail-ballots only. States that expanded vote-by-mail had a duty to ensure proper controls and safeguards to catch corrupt acts and real mistakes when they happened. Those states that did not do an adequate job ought to concern every American, regardless of party."

'Two weeks before that, narco gunmen shot up a government helicopter with a. 50 caliber sniper rifle near the municipality of Santa Ana. The following day saw reports of some 60 cartel fighters ambushing the Mexican military near the community of Cerro Canedo; eight people were killed, including a Mexican soldier. the bottleneck caused by the Title 42 rule has fueled a rise in violence and extortion of migrants in Mexico.\nRegarding the VP's portfolio, 'Harris will likely become the public face of a doomed effort to enact major voting-rights legislation that cannot be enacted without the filibuster reform Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (with a few other Senate Democrats probably quietly abetting them) have made impossible. And even if conditions on the border improve (which is a development hardly within the full control of the U. S. government), Harris will be identified with an exceptionally fraught issue that divides Democrats and energizes Republicans. 'Thus, through no fault of her own, she may suffer in public perceptions, particularly as Republicans focus their fire on her as a riper target (and as an obviously easier object for racist and sexist contempt) than the hard-to-demonize Uncle Joe.\nFox News harangues Harris daily, in articles on its website and in tweets. She confronts the confines in which a vice president has to operate on top of the similar confines in which Black people and women in positions of power are often expected to operate. It's a Goldilocks double or even triple whammy. Too strong a voice and you're stepping outside of your place. Too soft a voice and you're timidly failing to rise to the occasion. 'How sensitive to that is Biden, and how supportive? I don't detect any carry-over of the tension between him and Harris in the Democratic presidential primary, but it's important to remember that Biden's model for the relationship between a vice president and a president is his with Barack Obama, and Obama didn't nurture Biden's political ambitions or set him up for a promotion. He did that for Hillary Clinton instead. This is one fraught, fascinating vice presidency.\n\nRight:\nBiden, Harris, and the immigration- and foreign-policy team around them operated in denial on this issue throughout 2020 and into 2021, and it's still not clear that they're completely in touch with reality. When Candidate Biden and Candidate Harris promised to cease all border-wall construction, immediately end family separation, suspend all deportations for 100 days, 'end prolonged detention,  'end workplace raids,  and create a path to citizenship for everyone currently living in the U. S. illegally, Central American migrants and the coyotes interpreted that as 'The border is open. . 'It doesn't matter if they never spoke those specific words; this was the conclusion that the migrants came to because Biden and Harris never wanted to talk about enforcing immigration laws on the campaign trail. In 2019, then-candidate Harris declared her intent to use executive orders to end deportations and create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. How angry can you be at Central American migrants for believing Harris meant what she said?\nWhen Biden announced he was appointing the veep as his immigration czar, he was effectively passing her a grenade whose pin he had already pulled. When Harris went to Guatemala, that country's president flat-out blamed Biden's policies for the surge north. He said the United States' 'message changed to, 'We are going to reunite families and we are going to reunite children'. The very next day the coyotes here were organizing groups of children to take them to the United States. . 'Do not come,  Harris said in Guatemala. 'We will discourage illegal migration. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. . If you come to our border, you will be turned back.  That's not what Central Americans are hearing from their friends who are now comfortably ensconced in the US. Nearly half of those who show up at the border seeking asylum are being welcomed into the States, given orders to appear in court, and then set free. 'Harris can't clean up the mess at the border unless her boss decides to clean up his policy mess---by reinstating some of Trump's ideas.\nHarris has repeatedly claimed that she is addressing the 'root causes' of the migrant crisis, or, in other words, the pull-factors that might drive people to migrate in the first place. The first problem with this approach is that we have been throwing billions of dollars to Central America for decades and haven't seen a noticeable decline in crime and corruption, or an increase in economic security. The plan to nation-build our way out of a surge in illegal immigration calls to mind failed neoconservative projects to prevent terror by 'spreading democracy' throughout the Middle East. 'Second, even if such investment-driven solutions were effective, it would take years and years to see tangible returns. Meanwhile, migrants who falsely claim refugee status or political asylum (relatively narrowly defined categories) when their real motivation is a 'better life' will continue to flood the border. 'If Harris really had an interest in putting a stop to the migrant surge as soon as possible, she would visit the border and talk directly to these migrants, as well as local law enforcement and border patrol to ascertain what support they need to provide much-needed security for Americans living in border towns.\nRep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) writes, 'There are solutions available to rid our nation of this border crisis. For starters, we must resume the border barrier system, which includes technology and wall construction, to reclaim our national security. We encountered a border wall gate in need of desperate repair during my visit but were told it couldn't be fixed because of the current administration. Instead, a border patrol agent must be pulled away from other important duties to post guard to cover up the vulnerability. These ridiculous and grossly inefficient Band-Aids should be replaced with a strong wall system that works. 'Second, America must re-institute its 'remain in Mexico' policy. By having illegal immigrants remain outside of the U. S. while awaiting their asylum review, we not only save taxpayer money, but we respect the immigrants who are trying to enter our nation by dutifully following our laws and the standard process. That is the system that is fair for everyone. And third, America must work with its Central American partners to secure immigration agreements, much like the Trump administration accomplished. Only then, through a coordinated effort, can we reach stability at our border.",

The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. . If you come to our border, you will be turned back.

The first problem with this approach is that we have been throwing billions of dollars to Central America for decades and haven't seen a noticeable decline in crime and corruption, or an increase in economic security. The plan to nation-build our way out of a surge in illegal immigration calls to mind failed neoconservative projects to prevent terror by 'spreading democracy' throughout the Middle East. 'Second, even if such investment-driven solutions were effective, it would take years and years to see tangible returns. Meanwhile, migrants who falsely claim refugee status or political asylum (relatively narrowly defined categories) when their real motivation is a 'better life' will continue to flood the border. 'If Harris really had an interest in putting a stop to the migrant surge as soon as possible, she would visit the border and talk directly to these migrants, as well as local law enforcement and border patrol to ascertain what support they need to provide much-needed security for Americans living in border towns.\nRep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) writes, 'There are solutions available to rid our nation of this border crisis. For starters, we must resume the border barrier system, which includes technology and wall construction, to reclaim our national security. We encountered a border wall gate in need of desperate repair during my visit but were told it couldn't be fixed because of the current administration. Instead, a border patrol agent must be pulled away from other important duties to post guard to cover up the vulnerability. These ridiculous and grossly inefficient Band-Aids should be replaced with a strong wall system that works. 'Second, America must re-institute its 'remain in Mexico' policy. By having illegal immigrants remain outside of the U. S. while awaiting their asylum review, we not only save taxpayer money, but we respect the immigrants who are trying to enter our nation by dutifully following our laws and the standard process. That is the system that is fair for everyone. And third, America must work with its Central American partners to secure immigration agreements, much like the Trump administration accomplished. Only then, through a coordinated effort, can we reach stability at our border.\n\nRight:\nYears of reporting by journalists and research by nongovernmental experts reveal the factors pushing people north: powerful gangs conscripting teenage boys, sexually abusing young women, extorting local businesses and committing astonishing levels of murder; corrupt governments unable or unwilling to take control; broken economies; and climate-change-driven droughts in agricultural regions that have made subsistence farming impossible. 'The daily crises that lead so many people to decide that the dangerous trek to the border is a safer alternative to staying put will not be easy to solve. This will take patience, bold policy visions, and the support of an American public that sees the human tragedies at hand.\nProspective migrants tell us that they aren't chasing an American dream. It's a Guatemalan dream they're after, but they need to go to the United States to attain it. Given the chance, farmers in communities nestled around picturesque Lake Atitlan would build ecotourist lodges that showcase Maya traditions and environmental stewardship. Agricultural workers living in the lush volcanic highlands of Huehuetenango are tired of just picking coffee; they aspire to roast, package and ship their beans directly to hipster cafes in Guatemala City, San Salvador and Los Angeles. 'Getting results in Guatemala requires investing in the economic and commercial scaffolding that the country's entrepreneurial farmers desperately need, including access to land, fertilizer, water, roads, credit, technical assistance, broadband internet and the ability to sell their products directly to consumers. the United States needs to break a pattern in which foreign assistance is channeled through government contractors with too little transparency, too much overhead and scant connection to community priorities. We should seize the opportunity to work directly with local communities to fund sustainable development projects.\nCritics note that 'The current presidents of both Mexico and the U. S. came to office promising a safer world for migrants traversing this perilous landscape. So far, neither have delivered. April marked the deadliest month in Sonora in more than two decades.

There's no time to build a relationship and no room to risk selecting a dud who can't shoulder a big load. By that standard, Susan Rice is his best option. He already knows and trusts her (their offices were next door in the West Wing during Obama's second term) and she possesses a cool, commanding gaffe-free public presence that can fairly be called 'presidential'.

The Constitution vests ultimate power in the people, and throwing out their choice is in a way the ultimate undemocratic act. What impeachment also is not is a midterm check of 'fitness.  It is not a constitutional pause for a referendum on how the president is doing. It is not a way to resolve differences of opinion, policy, or propriety.\nImpeachment is also not a way to bypass other investigative tools and allow a partisan House to poke around a president's decisions, pre-election business deals, and personal life, or to amass info short of actual impeachable evidence as campaign dirt on the public dollar.\nWith the Mueller report's release, the investigation moved from the legal realm to the political realm. And in the political realm, the president has a simple and effective case to make to the 99. 6% of Americans who are not lawyers: They say I obstructed an investigation into something that didn't happen? And they want to impeach me for that?\nHaving one or even two or three Republicans sign onto impeachment won't make it bipartisan, and it won't have any impact on a Senate removal vote at all. People tend to forget that five Democrats voted for three of the four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. That didn't give the Clinton impeachment any 'bipartisan' gloss at all, nor did it convince Senate Democrats to remove Clinton, or even all of the Republican Senators, five of whom voted against removal.\nRegarding McGahn, 'he has every constitutional right not to appear, and this isn't a close legal call. This isn't a novel legal doctrine. For nearly 50 years, multiple administrations have held that Congress cannot compel the appearance of a close adviser to the President. That judgment has been backed by numerous legal memos. The view was reinforced and invoked by Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush. 'The reason is rooted in the Constitution's separation of powers and co-equal branches of government. The White House can't compel a Member of Congress to visit the Oval Office, and likewise Congress can't compel a President to appear on Capitol Hill. The same goes for senior White House advisers who are agents of the President and whose candid counsel he needs to fulfill his duties. Unlike cabinet officers who run departments, the only job of these advisers is to counsel the President. To allow Congress to haul presidential advisers to Capitol Hill would make the President subordinate to Congress and chill communications inside the White House.\nEveryone on Judiciary knows perfectly well that Congress can't compel testimony from top presidential advisers except in the most extraordinary circumstances: The chief executive's right to frank, confidential discussions with his staff is well-established. So Nadler's bluster about how he'll 'go to court to secure' McGahn's appearance is just noise for the cameras. Then again, that's all the testimony itself would be---a public spectacle telling no one anything new. With full White House permission, McGahn cooperated fully with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and it's all in Mueller's report.\nThe Democrats want to talk to Don McGahn, and maybe they will ultimately prevail in court to get his testimony, but what's the point? McGahn talked extensively to Mueller, and surely everything remotely damaging is already in the report.\nCongress has the report, and now it is up to it to decide. But it doesn't want to. It's too painful to admit that the Mueller report was a bust on Russia and that the obstruction material, while damaging to Trump, is hardly a slam dunk; that the public doesn't support impeachment; that if the House goes through with it anyway, it will end with a whimper in the Senate; and that it's better for Democrats to focus on beating Trump in 2020 than a forlorn impeachment.\n\nRight:\nAs attorneys sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States, we are deeply concerned by Trump's blanket assertion of executive privilege and refusal to submit to Congressional oversight, and his Administration's evident preparations for war with Iran. Political strategists have paid a lot of attention to the consequences of impeaching him in the House. But what about the consequences of not impeaching him? . . . 'They include. Engendering disrespect at home for the system of checks and balances that our Founding Fathers carefully constructed to insure that our free society would never be subject to a tyrannical, authoritarian ruler; Enabling this administration to continue to ignore longstanding domestic norms and law. and Countenancing this president's continued gross disregard for veracity and his penchant for obfuscation, deception and outright lies.\nThe Trump administration is now refusing to comply with perfectly lawful subpoenas issued by duly constituted committees of the U. S. If this president is allowed to get away with such defiance, why wouldn't the next president do the same---or go even further? What good is a system of checks and balances if officials decline to use the tools that the framers of the Constitution so painstakingly crafted? . . . Democrats' options for avoiding impeachment are narrowing. Amash's politically dangerous stand is a reminder that elected officials, regardless of party, are supposed to put duty first.\nIn 2015, Amash, along with 'some of most hard-line GOP lawmakers' -- as Politico noted at the time -- founded the House Freedom Caucus to push for laws that advocate very conservative positions. Amash has also long received high ratings from right-wing groups like the Conservative Review, which gave Amash an 'A rating' this year for 'supporting conservative principles' 90% of the time, placing him ahead of hardliners like Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Amash is clearly a dyed-in-the-wool conservative. And as such, he has put the US Constitution over partisan politics or loyalty to Trump.\nYet 'Amash isn't likely to be a bellwether for his party. He is a libertarian who has long staked out his own positions on issues such as gay marriage, government surveillance and Mr. Trump's entry restrictions on Muslim travelers. But what is remarkable about Mr. Amash's stand is how much tougher it is than that of the House's Democratic leaders to date.\nPelosi is right about impeachment under present conditions. But what she and the Democrats ought to be doing is changing the conditions. First, they absolutely have to get Robert Mueller up there as soon as possible. Second, if they can't get any witnesses from the administration to come before them, produce expert witnesses of their own. Get a parade of legal and constitutional scholars up there. Third, they need a much stronger rhetoric. Democrats have a big power: the power of the gavel. They need to use it.\nMany argue, 'President Trump has lied repeatedly to the American people about the existence of a plot by a foreign government to interfere in a democratic election, and about his campaign's connections to that plot; he repeatedly sought to abuse his power by impeding or doing away with an investigation into his own behavior; and he pressed for groundless investigations into his political opponents. Delaying impeachment proceedings signals that the devastating material in the Mueller report is not really so devastating at all. The moral urgency of impeachment can only remain ripe for so long.\nWhile Pelosi's let's-wait-and-see approach has sated the base -- and many members of her caucus -- until now, with every passing day that the Trump administration stonewalls legislative attempts at oversight, her position becomes that much harder to hold. And, if Democrats were to lose a major legal fight in the coming weeks over their demands for more information and transparency from the Trump administration, it's hard to see how Pelosi holds back the forces pushing for impeachment -- no matter the potential political impacts on the party come 2020. There's an itch for action -- and Pelosi may not be able to keep her colleagues from scratching it much longer.",

'But I don't see the suppression of high-profile liberals. How about Obama? Planned Parenthood? Emily's list? . 'There are reasonable answers to these questions. Liberals don't get fact-checked as much as Trump because his tweets are often not just untrue but, when the subject is Covid-19, genuinely harmful. And while Dorsey said it was a mistake for Twitter to have blocked the New York Post story---and the decision was reversed within 24 hours---the real reason, as Zuckerberg explained, was that the FBI had warned the social media companies to be on the lookout for a 'hack and leak' operation close to the election.\nOn the whole, data shows that conservative content thrives on social media. Conservative pundits like Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro consistently rank among the most shared news sources on Facebook. And despite all the hoopla about Twitter's alleged censoring of Trump, the president still uses the platform every day to reach tens of millions more followers than Joe Biden does. 'Republican senators asked why tech companies haven't fact-checked high-profile Democratic leaders like Biden as much as they have Trump, but they ignored the very obvious answer: that Trump, unlike Biden, has more frequently promoted false and misleading statements on social media. If Biden were to attack mail-in voting or the basic science behind Covid-19, as Trump has, he would likely face the same kind of moderation.\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives social media companies the power to filter, block, and remove information that is 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable' without risk of legal liability.

If the Trump proposal to limit Section 230 were law, tech companies could risk liability for removing ads targeted at Black users that spread lies. Twitter likely would do nothing in the face of destructive falsehoods like 'you cannot vote if someone in your household has committed a crime. . 'The Senate hearing and the Trump proposal are obvious attempts to suppress private speech. The First Amendment stands as a check against government censorship.

Governmental threats that stop tech companies from combating disinformation are far more dangerous to our constitutional values than social-media companies engaging in content moderation.\nThe Federal Trade Commission should publish guidance that clarifies the blurry line between content hosting and content creation.

Sure, he's successfully pushed candidates to talk about fictional fraud in the 2020 election, but Republicans were obsessed with fictional voter fraud long before Trump began his 2016 campaign, and resentment has been a winning theme in Republican politics far longer than that.\nMr. Mastriano pushed aggressively to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Pennsylvania, embracing the theory that the state legislature could void the results and appoint its own slate of electors for Donald Trump, for whom he is a sycophant. Mr. Mastriano pressed the Justice Department to get involved in the bogus fraud claims he sought to advance. Neither state GOP leaders nor the Justice Department followed along, which is why his push did not result in a major constitutional crisis. If he is governor in 2024, there is little doubt he would use his authority to reject free-and-fair election results, should the voters favor a Democratic candidate in the crucial swing state.",
        "document": "Did Trump choose candidates who were already well on their way to winning? Or did his endorsement catapult most of these winners to the top? Likely a mix of both, depending on the state. Oz, for instance, already had mega name recognition and familiarity thanks to his popular, long-running television show, and millions of dollars to finance his campaign. Other candidates, such as J. D. Vance in Ohio, received an undeniable boost because of Trump.\nRegardless, what other political leader in the last fifty years has garnered this kind of influence? Trump is a reference point for every forecast and factors into every politically oriented conversation. Every candidate I can think of was vying for Trump's endorsement and tried to endear themselves to him. What we've learned is that 'MAGA king' Trump is not infallible. And that's a good thing. But he is still very, very clearly the big, popular elephant in the room, and the movement he played a huge role in growing is alive and well.\nMeanwhile, it's obvious the left is still obsessed with (and afraid of) the former president. CNN was so giddy about Trump's potential fall from grace, they wrote the day before the elections that he 'could be facing an endorsement Waterloo this week.  The mainstream media appears to have taken these races more seriously than anyone on the right did, using these primaries as a test of Trump's popularity, both now and two years from now. After last night, they should be disappointed.\nHere's one thing we know for certain: every Republican candidate who prevails in the next round of primaries will do so because he or she supports Trump America First policies. As each primary comes and goes, one undeniable fact will emerge. Voters are longing for the Trump years of promises made and promises kept. They want a booming economy, low gas prices, a secure border, safe streets, and a peace through strength foreign policy. So, while tracking endorsements, wins and losses is good for ratings and clicks, it's important not to lose sight of where the hearts and minds of the American people are.\nA second takeaway from Tuesday's results is that Republicans have a real enthusiasm edge. In the Pennsylvania primaries, with potentially tens of thousands of ballots to be counted, at least 1. 33 million Republicans voted, compared with 1. 2 million Democrats. In the last midterm primaries, four years ago, at least 737, 312 Republicans and 775, 660 Democrats voted in the Keystone State.\nAs of this writing North Carolina Republican turnout totaled 759, 554 while Democratic turnout was 613, 170. Four years ago, 294, 295 Republicans and 431, 875 Democrats turned out in the Tarheel State primaries for Congress. The GOP turnout increases of 80% in Pennsylvania and 158% in North Carolina should worry Democrats."

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nWas the complete American withdrawal necessary? Of course not. In Iraq, around 2, 500 US troops remain in the country -- the same number that were in Afghanistan at the beginning of this year. In July, Biden announced an agreement with the Iraqi government that effectively relabeled the American troops in Iraq as 'non-combat' service personnel, while still leaving them in place. Biden could have taken a similar approach in Afghanistan. He didn't. 'Why Biden chose one path in Iraq and another in Afghanistan isn't clear. But what is clear is that a predictable debacle is now unfolding under Biden's watch in Afghanistan.\nMr. Biden called it quits, he says, because after 20 years of trying to get Kabul to govern effectively and fight harder against the Taliban, there was still no outright victory or prospect of one. But the United States was stalemated, not defeated. There's a difference---and how big a difference may soon become tragically apparent. In addition to preventing terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base for another 9/11, the United States achieved---or at least oversaw---real progress for the people of Afghanistan. 'When the Taliban ruled between 1996 and 2001, it forbade schooling for girls; by 2015, the last year for which World Bank data exist, more than 50 percent of girls attended first grade. Afghanistan's media have grown into some of the country's most trusted institutions. Most Afghans live in unfathomable poverty, but today's per capita income of around $550 per year represents a 66 percent improvement in real terms since 2002. Afghan lives ruined or lost will belong to Mr. Biden's legacy just as surely as any U. S. dollars and lives his decision may save.\nThe problem is not the Afghan soldiers, many of whom are fighting valiantly. The problem is that the complete U. S. withdrawal has made it impossible for them to fight coherently. It has meant not just the disappearance of American troops, who, in any case, hadn't engaged in direct combat for quite a while. (No U. S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since early February 2020. ). 'More crucially, it has meant the disappearance of close air support, logistics, intelligence and surveillance, repair and maintenance of weapons and vehicles, medevac units for the wounded, and rapid helicopter transport from one part of the country to another. Several senior U. S. military officers (active duty and retired) have told me that American ground troops couldn't fight effectively without these enablers. It is no wonder that Afghan ground troops can't either. 'It would have been more honest for Biden to say that Afghanistan's fate is no longer a vital interest, so we're leaving. It damages our interests to say, as he did in April, that we will still secure the government, protect women's rights, hold the Taliban accountable, and all the restknowing that, after the withdrawal, we would have no ability to do so. And if Biden didn't know that, he should fire whoever assured him that we could.\nSome argue that 'The growing disaster seems to support Biden's implicit argument that the US has failed to produce anything lasting in Afghanistan, despite the deaths and injuries of thousands of Americans, allies and local civilians, and the expenditure of more than a trillion dollars. 'Asked Tuesday if he would change his exit plan to head off a foreign policy humiliation for the United States, the President said no. 'They've got to fight for themselves, fight for their nation. . . they've got to want to fight,  he said -- a callous statement for the millions of Afghans now facing life under the Taliban's draconian rule. But this is Biden's cold-eyed judgment of his own country's interests. 'History doesn't always repeat itself. Those who warn a Taliban return will eventually threaten the US could be drawing the wrong lessons. Terror groups that seek to attack the US could base themselves in any number of failed states. And can the President justify committing more lives to a failure that seeds blame through four presidential administrations?\n\nRight:\nMr. Biden believes that further expending U. S. resources in Afghanistan is 'a recipe for being there indefinitely.  He rightly notes that President Trump had left him few good options by making a terrible deal with the Taliban. That's a fine argument, but it explains neither the hastiness nor the consequences we are now observing: the Taliban overrunning swathes of the country, closing in on Kabul, pushing the Afghan security forces and government to the brink of collapse and prompting the Pentagon to prepare for a possible evacuation of the U. S. embassy. 'As U. S. military planners well know, the Afghan war has a seasonal pattern. The Taliban leadership retreats to bases, largely in Pakistan, every winter and then launches the group's fighting season campaign in the spring, moving into high gear in the summer after the poppy harvest. At the very least, the United States should have continued to support the Afghans through this period to help them blunt the Taliban's latest offensive and buy time to plan for a future devoid of American military assistance. 'A responsible withdrawal needed more time and better preparation. History will record Mr. Biden, a supposed master of foreign policy for decades, as having failed in this most critical assignment.\nLast month, the United States evacuated Bagram Airfield in the middle of the night and cut off electricity to the massive base without notifying the new Afghan commander. By morning, looters had already arrived in search of weapons, ammunitions, armored vehicles and various other pieces of military equipment, managing to raid barracks and storage tents before being stopped by security forces. 'Given the prime role that Bagram held in offensives against insurgents, the responsible move would have been to ensure the smooth transfer of control from US troops to Afghan troops. As Gen. David Petraeus recently reiterated, we are not ending a war---we are simply leaving one.\nTeam Biden's plan A was to abandon the Afghan national army and hope that they held the line. That failed. Plan B was to ask the Taliban to stop winning. That also failed. So now we're on to Plan C: Claim that the Taliban crave moral recognition. Responding to a question on Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that 'the Taliban also has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community. . 'It's hard to see where such delusional rhetoric finds its source. Say whatever you want about the Taliban, but it's not as if they're quiet about their value set. Speaking to Axios, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid observed that 'we have never yielded to any foreign pressure tactics before, and we do not plan to capitulate any time soon either. \nDid the U. S. generals, statesmen, politicians and journalists who went to Afghanistan during these last two decades, and came back to testify to our steady progress, delude themselves? Or did they deceive us? How many U. S. generals knew what was going on but declined to risk their careers by telling Congress or the country that the Afghan army and regime we had stood up would likely collapse like a house of cards once the Americans departed and they had to face the Taliban alone?\nAt the same time, 'what a commander may have said in this or that interview should not obscure the most fundamental point in America's 20-year saga: Even the most powerful nation in the world can only do so much in a country whose politicians are uninterested in reform and whose state structure rests on a heap of corruption, parochialism, ethnic competition, political infighting, and side-switching. 'The U. S. was always fighting a losing battle, too often pulled further into the muck by the sunk-cost fallacy. Washington could never build a functioning, unitary democracy in Afghanistan. Regrettably, it expended far too much time, blood, and treasure before the U. S. foreign policy establishment finally reached the point of accepting this tough but straightforward conclusion.",

Regrettably, it expended far too much time, blood, and treasure before the U.

In Iraq, around 2, 500 US troops remain in the country -- the same number that were in Afghanistan at the beginning of this year. In July, Biden announced an agreement with the Iraqi government that effectively relabeled the American troops in Iraq as 'non-combat' service personnel, while still leaving them in place. Biden could have taken a similar approach in Afghanistan. He didn't. 'Why Biden chose one path in Iraq and another in Afghanistan isn't clear. But what is clear is that a predictable debacle is now unfolding under Biden's watch in Afghanistan.\nMr. Biden called it quits, he says, because after 20 years of trying to get Kabul to govern effectively and fight harder against the Taliban, there was still no outright victory or prospect of one. But the United States was stalemated, not defeated. There's a difference---and how big a difference may soon become tragically apparent. In addition to preventing terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base for another 9/11, the United States achieved---or at least oversaw---real progress for the people of Afghanistan. 'When the Taliban ruled between 1996 and 2001, it forbade schooling for girls; by 2015, the last year for which World Bank data exist, more than 50 percent of girls attended first grade. Afghanistan's media have grown into some of the country's most trusted institutions. Most Afghans live in unfathomable poverty, but today's per capita income of around $550 per year represents a 66 percent improvement in real terms since 2002. Afghan lives ruined or lost will belong to Mr. Biden's legacy just as surely as any U. S. dollars and lives his decision may save.\nThe problem is not the Afghan soldiers, many of whom are fighting valiantly. The problem is that the complete U.

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nA major reason Trump hates the 2015 nuclear deal is that despite the huge concessions the Obama administration offered Iran in the agreement---including over $150 billion in sanctions relief---Iran's behavior significantly worsened after the deal was announced. Iran's harmful actions included sending troops to Syria to fight in support of dictator Bashar Assad in a civil war, stepping up support for terrorism, and increasing military spending. Iran also ramped up its ballistic missile program. 'Iran's new provocation. will drive European and other states closer to President Trump's Iran policy. Hold-outs to U. S. Iran sanctions could soon drop their opposition. There also could be new European sanctions. Most importantly, President Trump's restraint in avoiding using military force against Iran---coupled with dangerous Iranian provocations like the seizure of the two oil tankers Friday---may mean that if President Trump decides to attack Iran in the future, he may do so with Europe's support.\nIran has made a strategic miscalculation here. Acting against the British while the U. K. and Iranian foreign ministers were seeking compromise over Britain's recent seizure of an Iranian tanker, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have further isolated Iran on the international stage. With a multinational naval task force for tanker escorts likely to be announced next week, the Iranians are increasingly outgunned and diplomatically isolated. Iran is heading for more economic damage. These seizures might make the hard-liners feel good, but they've made a big mistake.\nSome, however, advocate a less confrontational approach. 'A maximum pressure policy that was sold by its advocates inside the administration as a sledgehammer that would compel Iranian subservience to American demands has proven to be a deeply misguided approach. Iran has met sanctions and diplomatic isolation with resistance and aggression. Trump should go in a drastically different direction. Instead of responding to Iranian retaliation by doubling down with more sanctions, export restrictions, offensive arms sales, and threats of military force, he should provide the Iranians with an opportunity to pursue a diplomatic off-ramp. The current strategy, where Iranian officials are being expected to wave the white flag before even reaching the negotiating table, is about as likely to succeed as a climber scaling Mount Everest without a coat.\nWhether the Iranian military could defeat U. S. or allied task forces is an open question. But it is beyond question that Tehran can impose heavy opportunity costs on Washington. It's already doing so. After all, every gray hull facing down the Iranians is a gray hull not facing down Chinese or Russian fleets or pursuing other worthwhile endeavors such as training, scraping rust, or relaxing in home port.\nRegarding Rand Paul's diplomatic efforts, many argue that 'Iran's interest in negotiations is open to question. In 2015, former Senator and then-Secretary of State John Kerry said that Zarif had assured him that he was empowered to negotiate with the U. S. on regional issues like Syria following the nuclear deal. But that promise was empty. Iran ended up working out an arrangement with Russia to escalate the war on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. More recently, Zarif has suggested that Iran would be open to negotiations over its missile program. then backtracked from those comments. 'Zarif has frequently attacked National Security Adviser John Bolton on social media. Meanwhile, Iran's operatives have escalated attacks on U. S. allies. There's no doubt that Paul, a libertarian who has opposed U. S. interventions since he became a senator, is sincere when he talks about trying to prevent a war with Iran. His interlocutor, however, has a reputation for insincerity. The senator from Kentucky should be prepared to be charmed---and conned.\n\nRight:\nIran's actions are understandable, though not forgivable, in response to the unilateral rejection of the nuclear deal by the U. S. and, more importantly, President Donald Trump's decision to force everybody else to toe his line. Although the other parties to the Iran nuclear deal---the European Union, Russia and China---want to keep it alive, they have been almost powerless to preserve it in any meaningful way. By imposing extra-territorial sanctions on all buyers of Iranian crude with the threat of denying them access to U. S. dollars and the American banking system on which international trade depends, Trump has effectively forced everyone else to stop buying Iran's oil. To expect Iran to abide by its side of the nuclear deal without receiving any of the benefits of trade and investment that it was due to receive in return is naive. 'Yet should Iran's harassment of tankers escalate, the oil importing and shipping countries may have little option other than to align themselves with the Americans, at least as far as protecting vessels is concerned. But if they're going to use naval ships to protect tankers, they'll have to be prepared to use their weapons, and that is an escalation that everyone wants to avoid. With nearly 15 million barrels a day of crude flows at risk, it is a step that may have to be taken, unless both sides step back from the brink and work to find a diplomatic solution.\nForcing crisis after crisis is a tactic, one that the Trump administration deploys on fronts both foreign and domestic. But the tactic is in service of a dangerous strategy of brinkmanship. The last crisis with Iran, which centered on the downed American drone, was averted only after Mr. Trump said he had called off a military strike at the last minute. Mr. Trump, like Mr. Obama before him, has been right in recognizing the value of talking directly with one's adversaries. His administration long ago jettisoned the diplomatic protocol against direct talks with North Korea and the Taliban, and it now has the chance to make another grand overture.\nThe problem in Washington is that Trump has neither a strategy nor any strategists at his sideor at least none whom he's keen to hear. He's particularly disenchanted with his national security adviser, John Bolton; in recent weeks, he's bad-mouthed Bolton for his war-happy ways to several of his friends. Last month, when Trump sent Bolton off to Mongolia instead of bringing him along to Japan for the G-20 summit, that seemed a clear sign that his days were numbered. Meanwhile there is no secretary of defense and hasn't been a confirmed one since January. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose formal job description is chief military adviser to the president, is for the most part out of the loop. Trump is drifting toward conflict and has no idea how to stop it.\nThe President initially said he knew nothing about Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's engagement with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. However, a day later, Trump confirmed that Paul is involved in diplomatic talks with Iran. Paul is not known for his diplomacy within the US government, let alone with hostile foreign powers, and he has no known history with or special knowledge of Iran. The State Department has taken the lead in past negotiations with Iran, and it's unclear with whom Paul is coordinating within the executive branch, other than perhaps Trump. 'The confusing cacophony of other US government voices on Iran may leave the Iranians wary of engaging with anyone but Trump, if they really do want to de-escalate. Other Trump allies in Congress, like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have warned about an overwhelming US military response against Iran. Within the executive branch, it's hard to keep track of who has the latest instructions from the President. National Security Adviser John Bolton has made policy statements on Iran that have differed from the President's, including when he said the US would stay in Syria and fight Iran. the President needs to clearly identify someone to speak on his behalf publicly and, more important, behind the scenes, where the real action happens.",

His administration long ago jettisoned the diplomatic protocol against direct talks with North Korea and the Taliban, and it now has the chance to make another grand overture.\nThe problem in Washington is that Trump has neither a strategy nor any strategists at his sideor at least none whom he's keen to hear. He's particularly disenchanted with his national security adviser, John Bolton; in recent weeks, he's bad-mouthed Bolton for his war-happy ways to several of his friends. Last month, when Trump sent Bolton off to Mongolia instead of bringing him along to Japan for the G-20 summit, that seemed a clear sign that his days were numbered. Meanwhile there is no secretary of defense and hasn't been a confirmed one since January. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose formal job description is chief military adviser to the president, is for the most part out of the loop. Trump is drifting toward conflict and has no idea how to stop it.\nThe President initially said he knew nothing about Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's engagement with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. However, a day later, Trump confirmed that Paul is involved in diplomatic talks with Iran. Paul is not known for his diplomacy within the US government, let alone with hostile foreign powers, and he has no known history with or special knowledge of Iran. The State Department has taken the lead in past negotiations with Iran, and it's unclear with whom Paul is coordinating within the executive branch, other than perhaps Trump. 'The confusing cacophony of other US government voices on Iran may leave the Iranians wary of engaging with anyone but Trump, if they really do want to de-escalate. Other Trump allies in Congress, like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have warned about an overwhelming US military response against Iran. Within the executive branch, it's hard to keep track of who has the latest instructions from the President. National Security Adviser John Bolton has made policy statements on Iran that have differed from the President's, including when he said the US would stay in Syria and fight Iran. the President needs to clearly identify someone to speak on his behalf publicly and, more important, behind the scenes, where the real action happens.\n\nRight:\nA major reason Trump hates the 2015 nuclear deal is that despite the huge concessions the Obama administration offered Iran in the agreement---including over $150 billion in sanctions relief---Iran's behavior significantly worsened after the deal was announced. Iran's harmful actions included sending troops to Syria to fight in support of dictator Bashar Assad in a civil war, stepping up support for terrorism, and increasing military spending. Iran also ramped up its ballistic missile program. 'Iran's new provocation. will drive European and other states closer to President Trump's Iran policy. Hold-outs to U. S. Iran sanctions could soon drop their opposition. There also could be new European sanctions. Most importantly, President Trump's restraint in avoiding using military force against Iran---coupled with dangerous Iranian provocations like the seizure of the two oil tankers Friday---may mean that if President Trump decides to attack Iran in the future, he may do so with Europe's support.\nIran has made a strategic miscalculation here. Acting against the British while the U. K. and Iranian foreign ministers were seeking compromise over Britain's recent seizure of an Iranian tanker, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have further isolated Iran on the international stage. With a multinational naval task force for tanker escorts likely to be announced next week, the Iranians are increasingly outgunned and diplomatically isolated. Iran is heading for more economic damage. These seizures might make the hard-liners feel good, but they've made a big mistake.\nSome, however, advocate a less confrontational approach. 'A maximum pressure policy that was sold by its advocates inside the administration as a sledgehammer that would compel Iranian subservience to American demands has proven to be a deeply misguided approach. Iran has met sanctions and diplomatic isolation with resistance and aggression. Trump should go in a drastically different direction. Instead of responding to Iranian retaliation by doubling down with more sanctions, export restrictions, offensive arms sales, and threats of military force, he should provide the Iranians with an opportunity to pursue a diplomatic off-ramp. The current strategy, where Iranian officials are being expected to wave the white flag before even reaching the negotiating table, is about as likely to succeed as a climber scaling Mount Everest without a coat.\nWhether the Iranian military could defeat U. S. or allied task forces is an open question. But it is beyond question that Tehran can impose heavy opportunity costs on Washington. It's already doing so. After all, every gray hull facing down the Iranians is a gray hull not facing down Chinese or Russian fleets or pursuing other worthwhile endeavors such as training, scraping rust, or relaxing in home port.\nRegarding Rand Paul's diplomatic efforts, many argue that 'Iran's interest in negotiations is open to question. In 2015, former Senator and then-Secretary of State John Kerry said that Zarif had assured him that he was empowered to negotiate with the U. S. on regional issues like Syria following the nuclear deal. But that promise was empty. Iran ended up working out an arrangement with Russia to escalate the war on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. More recently, Zarif has suggested that Iran would be open to negotiations over its missile program. then backtracked from those comments. 'Zarif has frequently attacked National Security Adviser John Bolton on social media. Meanwhile, Iran's operatives have escalated attacks on U. S. allies. There's no doubt that Paul, a libertarian who has opposed U. S. interventions since he became a senator, is sincere when he talks about trying to prevent a war with Iran. His interlocutor, however, has a reputation for insincerity. The senator from Kentucky should be prepared to be charmed---and conned.",
        "document": "Iran's actions are understandable, though not forgivable, in response to the unilateral rejection of the nuclear deal by the U. S. and, more importantly, President Donald Trump's decision to force everybody else to toe his line. Although the other parties to the Iran nuclear deal---the European Union, Russia and China---want to keep it alive, they have been almost powerless to preserve it in any meaningful way. By imposing extra-territorial sanctions on all buyers of Iranian crude with the threat of denying them access to U. S. dollars and the American banking system on which international trade depends, Trump has effectively forced everyone else to stop buying Iran's oil. To expect Iran to abide by its side of the nuclear deal without receiving any of the benefits of trade and investment that it was due to receive in return is naive. 'Yet should Iran's harassment of tankers escalate, the oil importing and shipping countries may have little option other than to align themselves with the Americans, at least as far as protecting vessels is concerned. But if they're going to use naval ships to protect tankers, they'll have to be prepared to use their weapons, and that is an escalation that everyone wants to avoid. With nearly 15 million barrels a day of crude flows at risk, it is a step that may have to be taken, unless both sides step back from the brink and work to find a diplomatic solution.\nForcing crisis after crisis is a tactic, one that the Trump administration deploys on fronts both foreign and domestic. But the tactic is in service of a dangerous strategy of brinkmanship. The last crisis with Iran, which centered on the downed American drone, was averted only after Mr. Trump said he had called off a military strike at the last minute. Mr. Trump, like Mr. Obama before him, has been right in recognizing the value of talking directly with one's adversaries.

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nCombined state and federal corporate tax rates already put the average U. S. tax burden on businesses in the middle among OECD nations, at 25. 75 percent. The House Democratic tax hike would raise that to more than 30 percent. That combined rate would give the United States the third-highest combined corporate rate in the OECD, behind only Portugal and Colombia. 'Californians earning more than $5 million would face a 58. 25 percent marginal rate, while New York City residents earning more than $25 million would pay about 60 percent. Only Slovenia, Belgium and Finland levy higher or comparable rates. 'These tax hikes would also likely lead to tax increases for average Americans in coming years. The administration plans to use this money for new spending, not to help close the $1 trillion annual deficits that stretch as far as the eye can see. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds will also need shoring up in the next decade. If the rich and big business are already the most heavily taxed in the world, they probably can't be taxed more to save our entitlements or reduce the deficit. That means the money will come from where the rest of the world already gets it: the pockets of average taxpayers.\nThough the changes are all meant to target high-income taxpayers---who already pay a share of federal income tax that is far in excess of their share of income---according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, less than half of the new taxes collected would come from high-income individuals. The rest would come mainly from businesses, which invariably pass those costs on to their employees, customers, and business partners as far as they are able. 'Democrats here are pulling their usual stunt of assuring lower-income people that higher taxes won't fall on them, but only on their employers, their landlords, and their grocers, as though their finances were unconnected.\nThe political myth behind all this is that no one making less than $400, 000 a year will pay more. But the economic literature is clear that corporations don't pay taxes. They are merely the collection vessels for levies that are passed along to some combination of employees, consumers and shareholders. Much of the $900 billion will be paid in smaller wage gains for workers who are already paying a Biden tax from higher inflation. And who do Democrats think will pay the $96 billion they expect to raise from higher taxes on tobacco and nicotinethe folks who summer on Martha's Vineyard?\nPolls rarely ask these people what a 'fair share' looks like. Is a quarter of someone's earnings enough? A third? Because the rich have been shouldering an increasingly larger share of the cost of government. Despite perceptions, the highest-income strata of taxpayers are the only ones who pay a larger share of taxes than their share of income. In 2018, the top 1 percent of income earners made nearly 21 percent of all income but paid 40 percent of all federal income taxes. The top 10 percent earned 48 percent and paid 71 percent of all federal income taxes. 'On the other hand, in 2021, Americans making less than $75, 000 are projected to have, on average, no tax liability after deductions and credits. The average income-tax rate for those making between $75, 000 and $100, 000 is expected to be 1. 8 percent. More than 61 percent of Americans---around 107 million households---owed zero federal income taxes for the year 2020. the idea that the rich don't pay their 'fair share' is absurd.\n\nRight:\nThe country thrives when there's a transparent and equitable social contract between capital and labor.

A critical part of America's post-crisis rebuilding project is to restore the effectiveness of the government and to rebuild public confidence in it. The United States has a chance to emerge from this latest crisis as a stronger nation, more just, more free and more resilient. We must seize the opportunity.\n\nRight:\nThe first thing that should be said is that the outsized number of deaths in the black community is a very real and very serious issue that points to our nation's great failures in serving that community for decades. While disparities in the black community, not just medical, but economic and educational as well need to be dealt with in the long term, it is wrong to make it a focus of our immediate response to the coronavirus, which of late is looking to be very effective. 'The mantra on both the federal and state level during this crisis has been to get medical professionals and supplies to where they are needed as fast as possible.

If a hospital in Detroit needs ventilators we send it ventilators. We don't take a census of the patients to ensure some kind of demographic equality.

At that time, the racial disparities, which long predated the virus must be interrogated; better answers must be arrived at. But we aren't there yet.\nOur response to the virus should be as comprehensive as possible. We wouldn't want to miss, for instance, the possibility of a tragic and destructive outbreak in the county that in 2016 held the title for America's lowest male life expectancy due to its high concentration of health problems---that was West Virginia's McDowell County, a locale that is around 90 percent white. 'Rather than trying to draw a circle around a racial approximation of who has it 'worst,  we should marshal our resources and sympathies to ensure that nobody squeezes through the cracks. It may very well be true that in many locations, the majority or a disproportionate number of the people who hold the actual causal risk factors are African American or Latino.

Black people tend to be poorer, and poor people exercise less and smoke more, according to the CDC. It is not compassionate to constantly drill home the message that members of favored victim groups are incapable of determining the shape of their lives. Underclass whites have similar health problems because they, too, are making bad lifestyle choices. And they will be similarly overrepresented among coronavirus fatalities.\nI grew up in the rural South, and let me tell you, the diet of country people---black and white---is not what you would call healthy. What people call 'soul food' is delicious, but heavy on pork fat and salt. A lot of liberal commentators assume that poor people eat bad diets only because they have no choice; they don't give them agency, which is a mistake. Here in Louisiana, you run into people all the time who are solidly middle class, or even upper middle class, who have the money to eat healthier, but who won't do it because they were raised on high-fat, high-carb food, and that's what tastes good to them. 'You can't blame poverty for non-poor people choosing to eat food that makes them unhealthy. I am a yuppie type who has a much healthier diet than many people, but if I have to choose between going to Sonic for a double cheeseburger, and going somewhere else for a salad, that sure enough requires an exercise of willpower. Guess who is about 40 pounds overweight? Me! I think I technically qualify as obese. If I get coronavirus, I will suffer more because I am overweight, and I am overweight because of my diet and my lack of physical activity. Society didn't force me to be this way. I'm lazy, and I like to eat things that are not good for me.\nAt the same time, 'It is both possible and essential to provide poor communities with public health information and, where possible, testing and other health care resources via faith-based and other community institutions as well as public agencies. Increasing funding for federally funded community health centers is also essential, especially since many such centers have had to lay-off workers as they have shifted to providing mostly COVID-19-related services. Beyond these immediate steps, any 'after-action' study of the COVID-19 crisis needs a sharp focus on the relationship between race, illness, and the responses of federal, state, and local governments in preparing for and responding to the pandemic.

Guess who is about 40 pounds overweight? Me! I think I technically qualify as obese. If I get coronavirus, I will suffer more because I am overweight, and I am overweight because of my diet and my lack of physical activity. Society didn't force me to be this way. I'm lazy, and I like to eat things that are not good for me.\nAt the same time, 'It is both possible and essential to provide poor communities with public health information and, where possible, testing and other health care resources via faith-based and other community institutions as well as public agencies. Increasing funding for federally funded community health centers is also essential, especially since many such centers have had to lay-off workers as they have shifted to providing mostly COVID-19-related services. Beyond these immediate steps, any 'after-action' study of the COVID-19 crisis needs a sharp focus on the relationship between race, illness, and the responses of federal, state, and local governments in preparing for and responding to the pandemic. Like the response to Hurricane Katrina, we have thus far come up short, and we are running out of excuses.\n\nRight:\nWith every day that goes by, it becomes more clear that the virus isn't an equalizer at all. It starts with who's able to shelter in place---while many white-collar workers can work from home, a disproportionate share of the front-line workers still going to their jobs in many industries are women and people of color. And among those staying at home, inequality is still a huge issue, with some able to order delivery and others forced to visit overstretched food banks to meet their needs. 'While some health care workers, like doctors, can make a high income, inequality shows up within the health care workforce as well. Women and people of color are 'much more likely to be in those really front-line staff positions where they're less well-protected,  political science professor Julia Lynch said, such as catering or janitorial services in hospitals. In one poll of 250 hospital workers, mostly housekeepers and nurse's assistants, 75 percent said they were told they did not need protective equipment or had to ask a nurse for it.\nA recent PNAS study found that across the US, black and Hispanic people are exposed, respectively, to 56 and 63 percent excess exposure to air pollution---bearing the brunt of the health impacts. 'We've known literally forever that diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and asthma are disproportionately affecting minority populations,  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at an April 7 press conference. 'There's nothing we can do about it right now.  While he emphasized ensuring these communities get the best possible care, that kind of shoulder-shrugging is at the root of the problem---and shows there's never a convenient time to address a problem like this. 'But there are actually things that could be done right now: For one, expanding federal financial coverage for testing and treatment of Covid-19 so that low-income people have equal access to care. And, as John Balmes, a pulmonologist and spokesperson for the American Lung Association suggested to the New York Times, ensuring that hospitals in the most at-risk neighborhoods are prepared and prioritized for critical supplies. What's not helpful is placing blame on people of color.\nAs NPR reported, a recent study of several states found that doctors may be less likely to test Black people with COVID-19 symptoms. In the cities that do have testing sites, some of their locations seem to imply whose lives are considered most valuable. In Nashville, NPR reported that more affluent areas have had testing sites up and running, whereas three of the city's drive-through testing centers in diverse neighborhoods were closed for weeks because they were unable to obtain testing equipment and protective gear. it's irresponsible to discuss the impact of COVID-19 within the U. S. without discussing race.\nCamara Jones, a physician and epidemiologist who worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, states, 'The fear is, and in Italy, the reality was, that the very fact that they have diabetes or they have chronic lung disease or hypertension or some other kind of heart issue, that those things are going to be counted against them if a decision has to be made of which of these patients get the last ventilator. We're applying these criteria evenly to everybody, but without recognizing that the historical injustices that have made themselves evident in people's health status is not evenly distributed. If you were to disqualify people or even ding them a little bit in terms of a priority- based on preexisting conditions, that will systematically disadvantage people of color in this country.  Edwin Rios, Mother Jones\nThe government built highways that carried white families to new suburban neighborhoods where minorities often were not allowed to live; it provided mortgage loans that minorities were not allowed to obtain; and even after explicit discrimination was declared illegal, single-family zoning laws continued to exclude low-income families, particularly minorities. The inequalities of wealth have become inequalities of health. A middle-aged American in the top fifth of the income distribution can expect to live about 13 years longer than a person of the same age in the bottom fifth---an advantage that has more than doubled since 1980. 'The multi-trillion-dollar scale of the government's response to the crisis, for all its flaws and inadequacies, offers a powerful reminder that there is no replacement for an activist state. The political scientist Francis Fukuyama has observed that the nations best weathering the coronavirus pandemic are those like Singapore and Germany, where there is broad trust in government---and where the state merits that confidence. A critical part of America's post-crisis rebuilding project is to restore the effectiveness of the government and to rebuild public confidence in it. The United States has a chance to emerge from this latest crisis as a stronger nation, more just, more free and more resilient. We must seize the opportunity.",
        "document": "The first thing that should be said is that the outsized number of deaths in the black community is a very real and very serious issue that points to our nation's great failures in serving that community for decades. While disparities in the black community, not just medical, but economic and educational as well need to be dealt with in the long term, it is wrong to make it a focus of our immediate response to the coronavirus, which of late is looking to be very effective. 'The mantra on both the federal and state level during this crisis has been to get medical professionals and supplies to where they are needed as fast as possible. This has been achieved by looking at testing, hospital rates, models and an abundance of other tools that need not and should not take race into account. If a hospital in Detroit needs ventilators we send it ventilators. We don't take a census of the patients to ensure some kind of demographic equality. There will soon be a time for lessons, noting things we got right in fighting the virus, and examining the things we got wrong. At that time, the racial disparities, which long predated the virus must be interrogated; better answers must be arrived at. But we aren't there yet.\nOur response to the virus should be as comprehensive as possible. We wouldn't want to miss, for instance, the possibility of a tragic and destructive outbreak in the county that in 2016 held the title for America's lowest male life expectancy due to its high concentration of health problems---that was West Virginia's McDowell County, a locale that is around 90 percent white. 'Rather than trying to draw a circle around a racial approximation of who has it 'worst,  we should marshal our resources and sympathies to ensure that nobody squeezes through the cracks. It may very well be true that in many locations, the majority or a disproportionate number of the people who hold the actual causal risk factors are African American or Latino. But if we care for those people who hold the actual at-risk factors rather than trying to approximate them with racial generalizations, we should be able to respond in a way that encompasses everyone---whether they be black, Latino, white, Asian, Native American, or mixed-race.\nWhile economic inequality and unequal community resources are real, and society must work relentlessly to ensure equality of opportunity, those underlying maladies have a large behavioral component that remains within individual control. Black people tend to be poorer, and poor people exercise less and smoke more, according to the CDC. It is not compassionate to constantly drill home the message that members of favored victim groups are incapable of determining the shape of their lives. Underclass whites have similar health problems because they, too, are making bad lifestyle choices. And they will be similarly overrepresented among coronavirus fatalities.\nI grew up in the rural South, and let me tell you, the diet of country people---black and white---is not what you would call healthy. What people call 'soul food' is delicious, but heavy on pork fat and salt. A lot of liberal commentators assume that poor people eat bad diets only because they have no choice; they don't give them agency, which is a mistake. Here in Louisiana, you run into people all the time who are solidly middle class, or even upper middle class, who have the money to eat healthier, but who won't do it because they were raised on high-fat, high-carb food, and that's what tastes good to them. 'You can't blame poverty for non-poor people choosing to eat food that makes them unhealthy. I am a yuppie type who has a much healthier diet than many people, but if I have to choose between going to Sonic for a double cheeseburger, and going somewhere else for a salad, that sure enough requires an exercise of willpower.
