To put it in perspective, NATO recently deployed 4,500 troops in the Baltic nations to deter and repel a Russian tank assault. How many troops could possibly be needed to stave off an unarmed caravan of refugees walking up through Mexico?\n\nAccording to former Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, this is \"a misuse of active duty military.\" To say this isn't a political stunt is misleading the public.\n\nThe Trump administration has produced no evidence to support the president's repeated claims that criminals are in the caravan. Moreover, Trump's claim that \"you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process\" does not make sense. Many of the caravan members plan to request asylum, which requires that a person already be in the United States.\n\nNo doubt some of the caravan members will weigh the odds and decide they have a better chance of sneaking over illegally. But if even a few thousand were to try it, they would pose no unusual challenge to the Border Patrol\u2014which apprehended nearly 6,000 people every week last year crossing from Mexico. It's worth noting that while data specifically on refugees and those granted asylum are hard to come by, the New American Economy Research Fund looked at the 10 cities with the highest rates of refugee arrivals and found that \"nine out of 10 of the communities actually became considerably more safe, both in terms of their levels of violent and property crime.\"\n\nSome posit that \"the United States has sabotaged itself.\" The migration crisis stems not from foreign nations duping the United States but rather from American economic development policies that have exacerbated the poverty, despair, and violence such policies were supposed to alleviate.\n\nOthers ask, \"What do we do when the caravan gets here?\" And more saliently: \"What do we do if many more caravans show up behind it?\" This is not a passing crisis. It is the new normal, and its optics do nothing but intensify the cultural panic that is turning much of the West to authoritarianism as a response. Democrats can't keep dodging immigration as a real issue."

Liberals like to point out that we've seen a nearly 75 percent decline in arrests of illegals at the border since 2000, when some 1. 6 million were detained. True. But that still represents nearly 420,000 a year... 'Most of the coverage from the elite media reflects the reality that many elites simply don't see a problem here. And anybody who does is violating the norms of political discourse, as established and enforced by the elites.\n\nWe do not have the capacity to provide safe haven to every poor person in the world, but we can (for now at least) protect our own citizens... quoting the preamble, the Constitution was established to \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,\" not for the entire world.\n\nThis week the Mexican government offered the travelers refuge, supplies and the opportunity for permanent residency in two southern states if they applied for asylum. While hundreds of the Hondurans took them up on the offer, thousands more took a vote and decided once again to reject the plan... There's no reason the vast majority of them couldn't remain in Mexico.\n\nA \"reasonable inference\" is that the migrants are motivated not by a desire to escape persecution and violence, but by a desire to participate in the American economy... From the U.S. perspective, the desire of migrants to improve their economic status provides no legal or moral imperative for permitting entry.\n\nSome ask, \"How about a legal framework that considers border invasion the serious crime it should be?\" If the migrant caravan members not only understand they aren't welcome, but that they will actually be prosecuted under a statute that, if convicted, requires a penalty far more serious than a slap on the wrist, perhaps that Mexican asylum offer wouldn't seem so unreasonable by comparison.\n\nWill trying to stop the caravan work? Maybe, maybe not, but the point is to show an executive acting like an executive in defending the country's borders. Contrast this to the lack of effective action that took place during the 'children's caravans' a few years back in the Obama administration. The conventional wisdom was that it was impossible to secure the border against unwanted intrusions... But voters wondered why no one was even bothering to try to secure the border."

Beyond teaching the acceptance of differences, why confuse children under eight years old, most of whom do not yet understand the biology of sexual reproduction? What need is there for schools to introduce young children to the highly contentious metaphysical claim that your sexed body may not be your 'true' gender? If parents wish to discuss these themes with their children, they are of course free to do so. These are not hypothetical concerns. In November, the Littlejohn family filed a lawsuit against Leon County School Board in federal district court in Northern Florida, after they were excluded from welfare decisions regarding their 13-year-old daughter. The Littlejohns had informed the school that their daughter was confused about her gender and made clear that they did not consent to social transition. However, it later transpired that school staff had held private meetings with her, asking which pronouns she would prefer, which restrooms she would like to use, whether she would like to stay with the boys on overnight trips, and whether they should keep her parents in the dark.\n\nMany parents believe that classroom teachers should not show young, impressionable children pictures that depict breast-binding or encourage physically altering their growing bodies. They don't want children in early elementary grades to read books or use gender-coloring books encouraging them to disassociate their minds from their bodies, and to focus on sex and sexuality at such a young age. Young children don't need to be shown a Blue's Clues Pride Parade video celebrating transgenderism and pansexuality, or Queer Kid Stuff videos that train them to ask people for their pronouns, or be told that doctors are sometimes wrong when 'assigning gender.' Children should not be instructed that there is no such thing as girls and boys. Lest this sound like an unlikely scenario: a lawsuit is being filed by a Canadian mother whose six-year-old daughter was taught 'girls are not real, and boys are not real' at school. It's more than understandable that parents have asked legislators to curb such gender-ideology activism in schools.\n\nNo one wants a child to feel 'not valued' or conform to one point of view. The problem is that progressives think their point of view is the only one and everyone else agrees. Otherwise opponents are labeled as homophobic or anti-LGBTQ. What Republicans are pushing for, though, is allowing young children to just be children. The teacher can monitor"

When all the adults in a place are modeling exclusion and discrimination, kids will too. \"Whatever your views on LGBTQ rights and gender identity, barring teachers from even recognizing that gay people exist forces them to lie to their students and breaks down trust between students and educators.\" After all, millions of students nationwide have gay parents, siblings, friends, aunts, uncles, and on and on. They watch gay celebrities on television and in movies. Many will identify as LGBTQ themselves. Barring the mention of reality doesn't make reality cease to exist.\n\nSen. Jeff Brandes (R-FL) had proposed an amendment that attempted to remove the perceived stigmatization of LGBTQ people in the bill while still meeting DeSantis' objective. His amendment banned instruction of 'human sexuality' for children in third grade and under instead of singling out sexual orientation or gender identification. It had support from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates. But his Republican colleagues voted down the amendment. LGBTQ Floridians once hoped DeSantis could be an ally. Not anymore.\n\n\"Republicans, in their eagerness to get the 'don't say gay' bill across the finish line, revived a repulsive, homophobic myth: That queer people are pedophiles who recruit children. 'The bill that liberals inaccurately call 'Don't Say Gay' would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,' Christina Pushaw, DeSantis' longtime press secretary, wrote over the weekend on Twitter. She followed up by saying that anyone who opposes the bill is 'probably a groomer.' The term 'groomer,' of course, is just another word for 'child molester,' as actual pedophiles are known to 'groom' their victims before assaulting them. But (I can't believe this needs to be said in the year 2022) there is no evidence that LGBTQ people molest children at a higher rate than straight-identified people.\n\n\"These measures are rooted in the anachronistic belief that discussions about gender and sexuality somehow endanger children.

Will we have to go back to filing separate state and federal taxes, forced by the legal system to deny the existence of our relationship in order to complete our required paperwork?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, how will our child be treated as the kid of two moms in a country that is dismantling the careful framework we\u2019ve built to support the changing landscape and dynamics of what it means to love, to grow a family, to support one another?

My bosses? To strangers we pass on the street? What might a future look like where our family is no longer recognized?\n\nCongress exercises its constitutional authority to command nationwide uniformity under the full faith and credit clause. So, for instance, Congress has ordered every state to grant full faith and credit to a custody determination and child support order issued by another state. It took this step to prevent parents from kidnapping their children by absconding to a different state and relitigating a custody order against them. The proposed law similarly appears to protect same-sex couples\u2019 parentage rights over their own children.\n\nMany states only acknowledge these rights because of Obergefell, which compelled them to give same-sex parents the same \u2018constellation of benefits\u2019 afforded to opposite-sex parents. So, for instance, a state must place both parents\u2019 names on their child\u2019s birth certificate and afford both parents the presumption of parentage; they cannot force one parent to \u2018adopt\u2019 a child conceived through assisted reproductive technology. Put simply, the RFMA creates a backstop to ensure that every same-sex couple can retain protections after Obergefell\u2019s demise if their own state nullifies their marriage.\n\nRight-wing commentators and politicians will say that Obergefell is \u2018settled law\u2019 and point to Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s reassurance that the court will not use the same logic they used in Dobbs to overturn Roe v.

Some same-sex relationships clearly exceed some opposite-sex ones in these important measures. But marriage as an institution, including its governmental dimension, does not exist to award certificates of worthiness on loving relationships. Love needs no license from the state.\n\nThe reason marriage was considered the union of one man and one woman until just yesterday is because such unions, and only such unions, often produce children. The law never took a purely instrumental view of marriage, one that regards it as worthwhile only insofar as it yields children. But it did regard it as oriented toward child-rearing. It aimed, in a way that grew less coercive over time, to encourage adults to arrange their lives so that as many children as possible are raised and nurtured by their biological parents in a common household. Same-sex marriage was not the first step away from this model of marriage. Many social trends and legal developments have weakened the links between sex, marriage, and child-rearing. But that weakening has generally been regrettable rather than laudable. Republicans should reject the bill.\n\nTo disconnect marriage from a transcendent obligation to children, and to make it rather an expression of individual romantic feelings, is to fundamentally alter its character. Straight people did that before gay people ever started asking for marriage rights. Nevertheless, people like me correctly understood from the beginning that same-sex marriage was a Rubicon moment in advancing the Sexual Revolution. However strained the connection between marriage and its traditional purposes was under post-1960s cultural change, there was still the possibility of reform. With the normalization of same-sex marriage, that ended.\n\nBut \"the reality is that there is currently one vote on the Supreme Court to revisit Obergefell, which we know because Justice Clarence Thomas was the only one on the Court who signed on to the idea of revisiting it.\"\n\nThat's because overturning it would raise issues that striking down Roe did not. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in decisions in both Casey and Dobbs, \"reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.\" In contrast, the reliance interests arguments are much stronger when it comes to Obergefell given that same-sex couples have already been making lifetime commitments for years based on the outcome of the decision. Unraveling the ruling is simply not tenable.\n\nSome argue, \"the issue, at least as I see it, has always been whether"

In Arizona, the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month.

More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.\"\n\nAlthough the true number of unemployed people is a matter of debate, the data show that as many as 27.5 percent of Americans lost their job or had their hours scaled back as a result of the shutdowns.

Andrew Prokop, Vox\n\nEven the Justice Department's extraordinary decision to reverse course the next day noted that the guidelines 'enhancements'\u2014the factors that led to the original sentencing recommendation\u2014were 'perhaps technically applicable,' and prosecutors on Thursday did not dispute the applicability of those enhancements. In other words, Mr. Barr and those carrying out his wishes did not really dispute the facts and the law as carefully laid out by the career prosecutors. Instead, they presented a litany of the arguments that Mr. Stone's own lawyers had made for ignoring the guidelines and giving him lenient treatment.\n\n'Here's a question the Justice Department has not answered: Can it point to a single case in which the defendant was not an ally of President Trump, or someone who could testify against the president, where the department overruled career prosecutors to ask for a sentence 'far less' than that called for by the sentencing guidelines in a case that went to trial? Maybe for a drug offender? Or someone who broke immigration laws?'\n\nMr. Trump has claimed that the Constitution gives him 'the right to do whatever I want.' His lawyers have argued in a federal case involving his tax returns that a sitting president cannot even be investigated. They have also, in a head-spinning assertion of executive authority, dismissed any efforts by Congress to hold the president and the executive branch accountable. 'Characteristically, while interfering in the justice system, Mr. Trump is both insisting he's doing nothing of the sort and asserting his right to do so. 'Just so you understand, I chose not to be involved,' he said Tuesday in response to a question about his meddling in Mr. Stone's case. 'I'm allowed to be totally involved"

Pelosi had to bring along a caucus that wanted more comprehensive legislation that would cover all uninsured Americans rather than just many of them. She persuaded House Democrats to accept the best possible bill that the Senate would also pass.\n\nShe got the House to pass the $787 billion 2008 stimulus bill; the Dodd-Frank legislation reforming Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis; the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act attacking pay discrimination against women; and the repeal of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. Last year, under President Biden\u2014and working with the slimmest of majorities\u2014Pelosi shepherded through the House a $1. 9 trillion covid-19 relief package, a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that had been talked about for more than a decade; and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nMichigan Rep. Dan Kildee, a member of Democrats' whip team, told reporters Tuesday a story from when Pelosi was minority leader and Paul Ryan was speaker. It was during the water crisis in Flint, which Kildee represents. \"I still remember her calling me into her office from the floor, and getting on the phone with Paul Ryan, who was the speaker, and working it out for me to negotiate directly with Paul on Flint recovery,\" Kildee said.\n\nShe told Ryan she could deliver the Democratic votes he needed to pass a spending bill in return for him funding one of their priorities, and sent Kildee to Ryan's office. \"And so, over the course of a couple hours,\" he said, \"we worked out the Flint water crisis support, which was not widely supported by Republicans at the time.\" God knows how many stories there are like this from Pelosi's tenure.\n\nWhen John Boehner took over as speaker in 2011, he'd already been the No. 2 person in the Republican leadership.

One of the most striking features of Pelosi's tenure has been her ability, time and time again, to get moderate members of her caucus to vote for things that cost them their jobs (Obamacare being the most famous example).\n\nHouse Democrats throughout her tenure have played to maximize the success of the team: When out of power, they relax their ideological litmus tests in order to elect moderate-sounding people in swing districts, and when in power, they get those people to vote for progressive policy priorities knowing full well that this is not what their constituents want. But it's what Nancy Pelosi wanted. That's political hardball. It's why Pelosi became speaker twice, why she got things done for two Democratic presidents in the role, and why she has twice now found herself losing the majority.\n\nAs liberal as Pelosi's record was, she also had a pragmatic streak and attempted to walk the more radical elements of her party back from the ledge. During the Bush era, she fought back efforts by progressives to 'defund' the Iraq War, fearing that it would backfire by making Democrats come off as anti-troop. During the Obamacare fight, she helped persuade progressives to vote for a final version of the bill that did not include a public option.\n\nNancy Pelosi is a liberal who advanced liberal policies, but relatively speaking, she was also more pragmatic than the younger, more extreme elements within the party. Though we don't mourn her stepping down, without her at the helm, Democrats may have even fewer guardrails to prevent the party's continued leftward drift.\n\nTraditionally, defeated Speakers usually leave Congress, but Pelosi herself had already been an exception to that rule. She lost the gavel in the 2010 midterms, and failed to regain it in three subsequent national elections, including the one in which Barack Obama narrowly won re-election to the presidency. She regained it in the 2018 midterms, but then managed to be the first Speaker in long memory to lose seats while her party elected a new president. As Speaker, Pelosi will go out with a won-loss record in elections of 4-6.\n\nThat's not exactly a great record for an 'emeritus' standing. However, Pelosi raises tons of money for other House Democrats, and if she assumes that role, she likely will continue to control campaign cash, or at least"

An accurate and fair count of everyone in America isn't just any policy goal. There's much at stake with the 2020 census\u2014from the future of the next redistricting cycle to how billions of dollars in federal funding will be allocated. The Supreme Court should see this new evidence for what it seems to reveal: A blatant attempt to rig a constitutional mandate.\n\nThe newly revealed documents show that the Trump administration's purpose in putting the citizenship question on the upcoming census was not its stated one to help Hispanic voters under the Voting Rights Act, but rather to create policy that would be 'a disadvantage to the Democrats' and 'advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.' It's difficult to produce a greater smoking gun than explicitly saying you are hoping to help the GOP by increasing white voting power. 'Even if it is otherwise constitutionally permissible to experiment with different understandings of how to draw districts with equal populations under the equal protection clause, the government should not be able to do so if the purpose is to dilute the power of political adversaries and minority voters, as demonstrated in this case by the new revelations.\n\nLong before Trump was even elected, Republican Party insiders were plotting to increase white political power at the expense of people of color. After Trump was elected, they implemented this plan by insisting that their actual goal was the protection of minority voting rights. There was the real reason and the stated reason, the truth and the pretext. 'That the Republican effort to increase white political power might be motivated by partisanship rather than racism is little solace. Segregationist Democrats might not have insisted on disenfranchising black voters after Reconstruction had those voters not been staunch Republicans. Whether motivated by partisanship or racism, though, the result is the same. Yet the census case does not hinge on whether the citizenship question is discriminatory. Rather, as a matter of administrative law, the executive branch must follow certain procedures before making decisions. The Trump administration's blatant dishonesty settles the question of whether it followed procedure definitively: It did not.\n\nFederal law protects the privacy of everyone who responds to the census. But that's small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercount"

As Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas noted in a related opinion last fall, it's not unconstitutional for cabinet officers to have political motives for a policy. Political appointees also consult with outside experts like Hofeller all the time, as the Obama Administration often did on regulation and litigation. The real goal of flogging the Hofeller memo now is to raise enough of a political stink to intimidate the Supreme Court to block the citizenship question.\n\nThe citizenship question was asked routinely until 1950, after which it was removed from the survey. In the midst of our current immigration crisis, there is certainly very good reason to know how many of the people in the country are citizens, and how many are essentially guests, whether invited or not. The nation ought to be able to have the facts at hand as we decide whether to close the southern border \u00e0 la Trump or open it per Beto O'Rourke.\n\nEqualizing for citizen population, rather than total population, will have the effect of giving eligible voters equality of electoral power. Consider this: In states with large numbers of noncitizens such as Texas, New York, and California, some state legislative districts may have twice as many eligible voters as adjoining ones. This means districts with fewer citizens have more electoral power than the districts with more citizens. That isn't fair. \"Equalizing districts by the number of citizens prevents some voters from having their votes over-weighted and over-valued, while others are under-weighted and under-valued.\" If one-person, one-vote\u2014one of our most enduring egalitarian principles\u2014has any meaning, the citizen population gaps in voting districts must not be so glaringly wide. Without census data that includes citizenship status, it is probably not possible for states and smaller jurisdictions to draw election districts that equalize eligible voters.\n\nIt is worth noting that the citizenship question does not ask about a person's legal status; it merely asks about citizenship status and thus has nothing whatsoever to do with immigration enforcement. In fact, federal law prevents census data from being used for anything other than statistical analysis. That is the law and there is no evidence any agency intends to violate it. If there is a legitimate fear at all, it is that media hype may create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Add state taxes in Democratic enclaves and earners could pay well above 50% of what they earn to Uncle Joe. The plan is also a tacit admission that Medicare for All is a fiscal fantasy, since even current Medicare needs a giant tax increase. Imagine the rates required if Medicare covers those under age 65.\n\nThe White House proposal doesn't address any of Medicare's fundamental cost drivers, and even pretends it can rescue the program while charging seniors less. The fact sheet says the Administration will \"lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs subject to negotiation,\" limit some prescription out-of-pocket costs to $2, and lower costs for mental-health visits. More subsidies mean more costs, which mean more taxes and price controls. The only good news is that this plan is a political document with no chance of passing this Congress.\n\nBiden claimed that the limited \"negotiations\" in last year's massive spending bonanza will \"reduce the deficit by $159 billion.\" But even when Biden's analysts originally claimed savings twice that large from price \"negotiations,\" the Congressional Budget Office wrote: \"That decrease projected, but not yet realized was almost entirely offset by increases in projected outlays for other programs.\"\n\nBut now, Biden wants us to believe that even more government price negotiations---he wants to adopt these even before the limited test project for negotiations has had a chance to prove itself---will save yet another $200 billion. Biden is promising changes that amount to hocus pocus to achieve savings for both government and seniors that history shows will probably never materialize.\n\nThe president's implication that full benefits can be paid without raising taxes for 98 percent of families has no basis in mathematical reality. Imagine that Congress let the Trump tax cuts expire, applied Social Security taxes to all wages, doubled the top two tax brackets to 70 and 74 percent, increased investment taxes, imposed Senator Bernie Sanders's 8 percent wealth tax on assets over $10 billion and 77 percent estate tax on estates valued at more than $1 billion, and raised the corporate tax rate back to 35 percent.\n\nCombined federal income, state and payroll marginal tax rates would approach 100 percent for wealthy taxpayers, and America would face among the highest wealth, estate and corporate tax rates in"

Republicans have since tried to make it seem as if they never intended to gut the entitlements programs, despite widespread evidence to the contrary. His new budget proposal will force Republicans to make their stance on Medicare funding clear for all to see.\n\nBiden folded this proposal into claims that Democrats have already vitally improved Medicare's solvency via the cost-containment measures in the Affordable Care Act and the power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare that was featured in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. By proposing to strengthen Medicare's newly established negotiation power, Biden is now exposing and exploiting the GOP's extremely unpopular stance of solidarity with Big Pharma.\n\nAt the same time, he's countering Republicans' bad intent toward Medicare benefits with populist rhetoric about making the rich pay \"just a little bit more of their fair share.\" When Medicare was passed, the wealthiest one percent of Americans didn't have more than five times the wealth of the bottom 50 percent combined, as is now the case, so it only makes sense that some adjustments be made to reflect that reality.\n\nSome mix of benefit reductions and tax increases is necessary. Think about raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 to match the existing Social Security retirement age for those born in 1960 or later. Perhaps raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries with higher incomes. And maybe reduce Social Security benefits for those with higher incomes. Many of the Trump tax cuts expire in 2025. This could be leverage to negotiate tweaks to the payroll tax.\n\nWhat Republicans mostly talk about is raising the age cutoff for Social Security and Medicare.

Less than 20 percent of all people aged 65 or older still work or seek work. Employers don't particularly want them.\n\nA better way to save Social Security?

Bloomberg hit Bernie hard early on, but I'm not sure anyone noticed.\n\nCompared to her treatment of Bloomberg, Warren treaded much more lightly with Sanders, although she did draw more of a contrast with him than she has in the past. \"Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie,\" she said, explaining that she's had more success in the fights she's waged, such as pushing for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

For one thing, most of the attacks centered on electability. The argument wasn't so much that Sanders is wrong on policy, but rather that the boldness of his proposals make him unelectable and will bring down Democratic congressional candidates. Sanders deflected this line of attack by citing polls that show him running ahead of President Trump. Moreover, many Democrats admire Sanders for his boldness, just as they did in 2016.\n\nAnother reason Sanders made it through the night: the nature of the criticisms of him. Attacking him from the left, as Biden did on guns, may score a debate point but isn't going to convince people that Biden is the more committed progressive. Sanders owns that territory. While Biden's attack on Sanders over his praise for the Cuban government was correct in its gist\u2014he has been an apologist and contextualizer for left-wing dictators\u2014the details were mistaken and won't hold up as the argument is litigated in coming days.

He answered nearly every criticism by returning to a familiar riff about billionaires. (He's against them.) That tack won't work if he's the nominee. Voters at large are much more hostile to socialism, at home and abroad, than Democratic voters are. But it was enough to keep him just as secure in the front-runner position as he was at the start of the night.\n\nPete Buttigieg got off the best line when he said Sanders has 'nostalgia for the revolution politics of the '60s.'

The deal still has to be passed by the House and Senate, and signed by Trump. But by striking such a deal, congressional leaders and the Trump administration are averting a disaster scenario.\n\nDiscretionary spending has been declining steadily for four decades, interrupted only by the Iraq War and the Great Recession. The new budget deal will keep it at about 6 percent of GDP, the same as it was in 2000 and far less than it was in 1980. This is hardly a picture of a budget that's skyrocketing out of control. If the hawks want to gripe about mandatory spending\u2014primarily Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other social welfare programs\u2014that's fine. Gripe away. But today's budget deal has nothing to do with that.\n\nMany argue, 'It's official: Conservatives only care about deficits when a Democrat is president.' Everyone in Washington seems to suddenly accept the economic and political benefits of government spending, as the GOP hopes to keep the stock market goosed past Trump's reelection. While it's great that Washington appears to have avoided another truly stupid, self-inflicted government shutdown, Congress is whistling past the graveyard. That's because deficits are growing while the economy is booming\u2014up 23% in the first nine months of the fiscal year alone. That's not supposed to happen. And there will be hell to pay when the remorseless math of rapidly falling tax revenue kicks in during the next downturn.\n\nIt's often overlooked, but the biggest economic improvement since Trump took office is more government spending.\n\nI don't doubt that many House members elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 truly thought they were helping the economy by trying to bring federal spending down. But Congressional Republicans' overall loss of interest in deficit reduction after Trump's inauguration does seem to indicate that partisan calculations were paramount. House Democrats, meanwhile, have far less ideological reason to oppose increases in government spending. But their unwillingness since taking charge in January to play hardball on legislation that might endanger the ongoing expansion also seems to bespeak a different attitude toward partisanship and macroeconomic policy.

There are many ways in which the Trump presidency has been disruptive to the status quo. But when it comes to spending and deficits, he has restored Washington to a much more conventional place in which both parties agree to ignore warnings of fiscal disaster, and resolve their differences by simply agreeing to spend more money. \"Trump's Republican Party may want to dismiss the importance of the debt, but the numbers don't lie. The nation's federal debt will surpass unprecedented levels in the coming decades, and neither party even wants to pretend to care about it.\"\n\nThe tea party burst into Washington pledging spending restraint, balanced budgets, and accountable government. Even the possibility of defaulting on the national debt was an acceptable price of reform. Roughly a decade later, budget deficits are again reaching $1 trillion, spending is soaring, Obamacare remains on the books, and Republicans are raising the debt limit and eviscerating their lead accomplishment, the Budget Control Act. With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?\n\nThis is exactly how Washington has worked for decades. This is a place where politicians splurge today, and promise to repent tomorrow. And where 'compromising' means adding your differences together, rather than splitting them. To understand what this means for the deficit, consider that if Congress had simply held spending growth to the rate of inflation after 2014, the deficit this year would be $400 billion, instead of more than $1 trillion. \"It's important to note that this problem is not being driven by Trump's tax cuts. Even with those cuts in place, federal revenues are near the postwar average, and they are slated to continue to claim a larger share of GDP each year for the next several decades. The problem is entirely on the spending side. The CBO's forecast has spending closing in on 30% of GDP by 2049---and that's assuming there aren't any major new entitlement programs.\"\n\nThe good news\u2014the only good news\u2014is that the deal continues the Trump Administration's modest defense buildup. Several years in a row of predictable, higher funding will allow the Pentagon to improve the readiness of fighter squadrons, build a few more ships, improve missile defenses and invest in technology\u2014all necessary for maintaining the military's competitive edge.

A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon?\n\n'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations.'\n\n'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.'\n\nThe post-Floyd reckoning in the media has emphasized the need for journalists to look skeptically at claims from police and other officials following a killing, as they may come undone when more facts come to light. Shortly after the March 29 death of Toledo, a Cook County prosecutor claimed that Toledo was shot while holding a gun in his right hand. But body camera footage released on Thursday suggests this claim was inaccurate, as it appears to show the boy unarmed and with his hands raised when he was shot. Officials also described the incident as an 'armed confrontation,' without noting that Toledo had complied with officer instructions to drop the firearm and put his hands up.\n\nJustice for Adam Toledo requires investments in our Black and brown communities and disinvestments in policing.

The resources include funds for positive youth spaces, political and art education, mental health treatment, restorative justice, and conflict resolution services.

And these were not ideal conditions in which to make a split-second decision: it was dark, and Stillman's heart rate and adrenaline levels were likely elevated due to the foot chase. \"Was it really so unreasonable for Stillman to have genuinely perceived a risk to his own life when he decided to pull the trigger?

It will also help grease the wheels for the passage of the larger multi-trillion welfare bill that will expand Medicare and Obamacare, initiate a federal takeover of preschool and childcare, and impose economically devastating tax increases on individuals and businesses. Biden entered this week reeling from a devastating rebuke of his presidency by voters in areas of the country thought to be reliably Democratic. He headed into the 2022 election year a wounded animal, and Republicans stood to make major gains. Now, they tossed him a life raft and allowed him to put bipartisan gloss on his radical agenda. Every Republican who voted for this monstrosity who is not already retiring should be primaried and defeated.\n\nOther argue, \"It's true that without the 13 Republicans, the bill would not have passed Friday night. But, there was simply no way that the progressive House members were going to allow their party to march into 2022 with absolutely nothing to show for all of their efforts.

Multiple administrations and Congresses talked about addressing the problem. \"Infrastructure week\" became a running gag during Donald Trump's presidency, because of his constant invocation of the concept and complete inability to deliver on it. But Joe Biden has delivered. This is a major win for America.\n\nThere is a great deal to celebrate in the package, which independent economists say may create over half a million jobs. As well as investing in America's physical infrastructure like road, rail and broadband networks, it also makes the country's first major investment in helping communities prepare for extreme weather events caused by climate change. There's also chunks of money to upgrade the electrical grid and protect it from extreme weather, to expand the nation's network of electric vehicle charging stations, and to invest in experimental forms of clean energy. \"No-one should mistake this for anything other than a major victory for the Biden administration, which even managed to persuade a sizeable number of Republicans in the Senate and the House to vote in favor. It's exactly the type of major bipartisan win which Joe Biden promised during his campaign, and which naysayers said he would never achieve.\"\n\nSkittish Democrats complain Biden and his team have done too little to trumpet their successes\u2014including the American Rescue Act, which helped keep the economy afloat and provided lifelines to millions of Americans through stimulus checks and a landmark family tax credit projected to cut child poverty in half. \"But the Delta variant, natural disasters like Hurricane Ida, and the fallout from the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan prevented the Biden administration from finding the right opportunity to sell the legislation, along with the rest of his agenda, to the American people. \"Now, having passed another major legislative package, Biden and the Democratic Party have a second chance to make clear what they have delivered. Biden's task is to move beyond the unsightly legislative sausage-making and convert his victory into tangible signs of progress, be they roads, bridges or broadband Americans can see in their own communities.\"\n\nPassing the infrastructure bill counts as a significant victory for Biden.

Kennedy was obviously in the midst of his official duties when he kneeled on the field, in uniform, responsible for the conduct of his students. And when he led his prayer circles, he was not 'quiet,' but loud and prominent by design. His expression was a quintessential example of on-the-job 'government speech' that, according to Garcetti, falls outside the First Amendment.\n\nTo reach his conclusion, Gorsuch simply rewrote the facts. In his account, Kennedy had been suspended exclusively for his silent prayer\u2014not the spectacle he created by hijacking football games with prayer circles. And because this prayer was allegedly so 'quiet,' it qualified as 'private' expression shielded by the First Amendment.\n\nThe coach's prayer, Gorsuch insisted, 'was not delivered as an address to the team, but instead in his capacity as a private citizen.' So even though he was in the middle of a field that he could only access because he was performing his job responsibilities, his speech bore no imprint of government approval, and was totally unconnected to his work as a coach.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, declared: \"Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse Republic\u2014whether those expressions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether they manifest through the spoken word or a bowed head.\"\n\nIn doing so, Sotomayor wrote, the court 'elevates one individual's interest in personal religious exercise, in the exact time and place of that individual's choosing, over society's interest in protecting the separation between church and state, eroding the protections for religious liberty for all.'\n\nThere is a greater issue that the majority, in their zeal, chose to ignore: the freedom of the students to not pray. I'm sure they would say that this freedom remains, and no one has to pray if they choose not to. But such a perspective is risible. Anyone who has ever played high school sports knows that if your coach is doing something, particularly something religious, and expects you to join, then you had better do it.

Justice Gorsuch replies that the First Amendment makes both promises in a single sentence. \"A natural reading,\" he says, \"suggests the Clauses have 'complementary' purposes, not warring ones.\" He says the school punished Mr. Kennedy under \"a mistaken view that it had a duty to ferret out and suppress religious observances.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is gradually restoring a proper constitutional understanding of the relationship between religion and the state. The Court in the 20th century began to use the Establishment Clause to let government restrict religious behavior and speech that is protected by the Free Exercise Clause. The Roberts Court's religious liberty rulings don't risk any state establishment of religion. But they do let Americans of faith express their views\u2014as the Founders intended.\n\nThere is no indication in the record that anyone expressed any coercion concerns to the district about the quiet, postgame prayers that Kennedy asked to continue and that led to his suspension. Nor is there any record evidence that students felt pressured to participate in these prayers.\n\nThe district suggests that any visible religious conduct by a teacher or coach should be deemed\u2014without more and as a matter of law\u2014impermissibly coercive on students. Such a rule would be a sure sign that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence had gone off the rails.\n\nInstead of a court-invented three-part test, Gorsuch and his five colleagues offer an empirical analysis of historical practices and understandings as a way to judge whether a government entity has violated the First Amendment by becoming too enmeshed in promoting religion. That is exactly as it should be. The original public meaning of the First Amendment, Gorsuch explained, \"counsels mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.\"\n\nGorsuch wrote: \"Learning to tolerate speech of prayer of all kinds is 'part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society,' a trait of character essential to 'a tolerant citizenry.' \" He also noted: \"Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse republic.\" An assistant coach's noncoercive prayer, during a postgame interlude in"

The reporting requirement in force in 2008, he says, excepted all 'accommodations and transportation for social events,' although it was recently clarified to require greater disclosure. In fact, the 2008 hospitality exclusion applied only to food, lodging, and entertainment, with no mention of transportation.\nAlito can argue the finer points of disclosure and recusal, but there is a greater issue involving the justices' ready acceptance of lavish gifts from wealthy and politically active benefactors. Alito and Thomas, and perhaps others yet unknown, have not hesitated to vacation on the tab of the super-rich, rationalizing that they avoid talking law with their hosts, who, they assure themselves, do not have cases before the Court.\nBut influence does not arise only from outright favor-trading. Studies have shown that physicians' prescribing practices can be influenced by such minor gifts as pens, notepads, and sandwiches. One study of over 125,000 physicians found that receipt of a single inexpensive meal was associated with increased prescriptions of the donor's brand-name medication. Supreme Court justices no doubt believe they are immune to such effects, but so do doctors.\nCan anyone say with a straight face that no 'unbiased and reasonable person' would question the justice's impartiality when he votes for someone who gave him a valuable gift? Isn't there at least the appearance that something other than the strict application of the rule of law is at work? And appearances count, perhaps nowhere more than at the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of many of the most fraught issues of American life.\nIf the justices are confused as to the reason public trust in the court is in free fall, they need look no further than Justice Alito's smug, defensive reaction to a very fair criticism. As long as the court refuses to accept significantly stricter ethics rules, either adopted by themselves or imposed by Congress, that trust\u2014and with it the court's legitimacy\u2014will continue to erode until it's not worth a seat on a private jet.\nProPublica's reporting hints at the larger scandal of conservative donors becoming financially enmeshed with the justices they sponsor.

Six of the Supreme Court's nine members received paid trips to Europe in 2014, including to Berlin, London and Zurich\u2014and New York University also paid for Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to travel to Florence, Italy. In 2012, Ginsburg traveled to New York to accept Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year award, which came with a gift bag valued at $2,500.\n\nThe one case involving Singer's litigious hedge funds that made its way before the Court on its merits was Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, a 2014 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act case involving Argentine sovereign debt. The case wasn't close; the Singer-related fund won 7-1. Moreover, even if Alito should arguably have recused himself for all time from Singer-related cases, the court papers in the case also didn't disclose\u2014and weren't legally required to disclose\u2014that the NML Capital fund was a Singer vehicle.\n\nProPublica and other captive outlets of the Democratic Party are doing whatever they can to create 'scandals' around the Supreme Court. It's not that they expect any particular faux-scandal to stick, but they hope that raising one after another will create a generalized perception that the court is corrupt, and its decisions\u2014say, overturning affirmative action, or upholding gun rights\u2014will thus be delegitimized, making it easier for Democratic officials to disobey them.\n\nAt the same time, the 'ethics' attacks on the court serve as a smokescreen to conceal the much bigger ethical problems that go unaddressed.

But scoring points doesn't count for much when the economy is in freefall and America's cities are shutting down to slow the pandemic's spread.\n\nBiden was about as sharp as he's been throughout the entire primary. He projected confidence and competence on the coronavirus pandemic, arguably beating Bernie on points when it came to Medicare-for-all's relevance to the crisis.

Kids may not go back to school before autumn, and the economy is about to get pummeled, which makes the issue of the temperature in a hundred years seem particularly insignificant in the here and now.\n\nBernie is, in practical terms, finished, and he plainly knows it. His clear goal in this debate, in the vein of issue and movement candidates since time immemorial, was to push his agenda on the party. Biden, though he came onstage wearing a red tie, took the bait. He bragged about his shifts to the left on abortion and immigration. He promised \"no new fracking,\" committed to crackdowns on oil drilling, and pledged himself to the \"New Green Deal.\" Some of those lines were delivered in gift-wrapped sound bites for the Trump campaign. All of which is why Biden, though he looked better than usual in this format, probably won't want to debate Bernie Sanders again.\n\nBiden's new position on immigration is that if he is elected, no one will be deported in his first 100 days as president. And he said a person who enters the U.S. illegally won't be deported even if the person has a criminal record in any foreign country, unless the immigrant is convicted of a felony in the U.S. That position on deportations is an extreme one that could cost Biden votes even in Hispanic communities among people who fear that new neighbors who have committed crimes elsewhere might commit crimes again in the U.S. Then Biden sought to appease the environmental community by pledging that there would be \"no new fracking\" if he becomes president, and also said he would ban drilling for fossil fuels on public lands. Given the importance of fracking to the economies of key electoral states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and even Colorado, Biden is opening himself up to relentless attacks by Trump in the fall that he is anti-jobs and that he would make America dependent on imported oil and natural gas.\n\nSanders argues that if we had socialized health insurance right now, nobody would have to pay for testing or treatment for the coronavirus.

Nevertheless, the president has no legal basis to adjourn Congress and make recess appointments.\"\n\nLike ending debate, confirming a nomination can be done quickly or slowly. Unanimous consent or a voice vote do not require the presence of all senators and can take a minute or two. If the minority refuses, however, the only option is a formal recorded vote that does require the presence of all senators and takes, on average, 35 minutes or more. The Senate took 173 recorded confirmation votes on executive branch nominations during the first term of the previous five presidents, Ronald Reagan through Obama. So far, the Senate has been forced to take 179 recorded confirmation votes, and Trump's four-year term has almost nine months to go. \"This outward example of the anti-Trump 'resistance movement' has had another debilitating consequence: It has resulted in scores of qualified nominees pulling out of the process because of long delays and frustration, or otherwise good people declining to be nominated because it likely would not result in a confirmation. The Democrats' resistance tactics have hampered the work of the entire executive branch and also affected key agencies during the present coronavirus crisis.\"\n\nAt the same time, \"Imagine how absurd it would be if the president could force Congress to adjourn at will. He'd be able to fill vacancies with recess appointments anytime he liked, provided, I guess, that he could convince the courts that it was an 'extraordinary occasion.' The Senate could willingly hand him that authority by moving to adjourn and then squabbling with the House over the duration"

Mr. Trump thinks his trade machinations can overrule the realities of the marketplace, but he's wrong. If he intervenes to make GM less competitive, Mr. Trump will merely hurt more workers.\nI oppose all forms of subsidies to the private sector, but I am also appalled by the use of subsidies as a way for the president to get companies to do what he thinks that they should be doing, especially after imposing metal tariffs\u2014punitive taxes on a major input that unquestionably increases automakers' costs of production and thereby forcing them to hike their prices.\nYou cannot subsidize your way to sustainable manufacturing jobs, as former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried. However, just as you cannot subsidize your way to prosperity, so you cannot tax your way to it, as Trump has done, in this case with tariffs against imports.\nThe politics of these closures will damage both parties. Democrats led by Barack Obama went all-in on a government bailout and politically driven bankruptcy settlement for GM in 2009, which cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. More acute, however, will be Donald Trump's claims on economic boom times as the American auto industry sheds jobs on an industrial scale.\nGM got a bailout. Taxpayers made it possible for the company to restructure and stay in business. There is a reason for the rise of populist sentiment in America. It comes down to a sense that the game is rigged.

Rather, they were automated. That's why U.S. factories are producing twice as much as they did in 1984, but have shed over 5 million jobs since 1987. That's also why Trump's solution, to impose heavy tariffs on our trading partners, has not worked and has, in fact, killed more jobs by making everything more expensive.\"\n\nWhat GM and every competitive American company does is follow the customers. Last quarter General Motors sold more vehicles in China than in the United States. Making cars in America for export to China would render them 'structurally unprofitable.' It would be helpful if Trump recognized that being president doesn't make him economy czar; he can't force companies to continue to operate factories that aren't profitable.\n\nAs 14,000 people and their families fretted looming unemployment, with Christmas just weeks away, investors celebrated. GM stock closed up 5 percent on Monday. This points to the growing disconnect between what's good for Wall Street and what's good for Main Street.

Yes, Kyiv will live with the scars of war, but ultimately, these munitions will save Ukrainian lives.\n\nSome argue, \"the American response to Ukraine is entirely out of proportion for a country long acknowledged not to implicate core U.S. interests.\" It's also potentially catastrophic: Gradually escalating is all fun and games until a nose-bloodied and humiliated Putin lobs the first tactical nuke in Ukraine or launches a massive conventional strike on, say, Poland, and then the world as we know it comes to an end.\n\nAs the Biden administration conceded recently, one reason Washington is turning to gruesome cluster munitions to bolster Kiev is that America's military-industrial base isn't keeping up with the war's demands\u2014itself a symptom of a generational, bipartisan abandonment of U.S. manufacturing. If the 'pittance' of a war in Ukraine is stretching the Pentagon's conventional stockpiles, imagine the industrial incapacity that a confrontation with China over Taiwan might reveal."

It is half a century since the US stopped bombing Laos, having dropped more than 2 million tons of cluster munitions; decades on, people then unborn are still paying the price. On one estimate, it will take another 100 years to fully clear the country. This is the true cost of cluster munitions.\n\nThe argument is that, however significant the risks and long-term costs of using cluster bombs, civilians will pay a far higher price where Russian forces prevail. Cluster munitions are effective in combating dug-in ground troops, like the Russian forces along the vast frontline.\n\nBut the same, of course, could be said for chemical weapons, and the US rightly finished destroying its remaining stockpile of those on Friday. Efficacy is why bans on such arms are needed in the first place. Russia's use of them is not a reason to further drag down international norms.\n\nTo suggest that cluster bombs can be used discreetly against military targets in Ukraine is an illusion. The lesson from Laos and the consensus of all nations who have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions is that there is no responsible use of cluster bombs. This consensus emerged out of intense research and study of the actual failure rates of cluster munitions in warfare. Any use of cluster bombs in Ukraine by any of the parties to the conflict will extend the human suffering well past the end of military hostilities.\n\nSome argue, \"Let's get real: Ukraine's democratically elected leaders, whose relatives, friends, and neighbors are in the line of fire, are more mindful of minimizing Ukrainian casualties than are self-appointed humanitarians in the West watching the war on television. We need to respect their decision.\"\n\nCluster munitions remain a lawful instrument of warfare for countries that haven't signed the 2008 convention, and Kyiv has shown itself a responsible steward of all the Western weaponry it has received. Zelensky and his generals are, in fact, so worried about needless loss of life that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is progressing too slowly for the liking of some observers in the West. Unlike the Putin regime, the Zelensky government is not willing to butcher its own men in human-wave attacks. Using cluster munitions has the potential to save the lives of many Ukrainian soldiers."

Then they reported on it with that supporting testimony to back it up. \"If the FBI had found anything tying the laptop to the Russians, we'd probably have heard about it by now.\" I'll even concede that it's still possible that some bad actors, be they foreign or domestic, could theoretically have been involved in making the contents of Hunter Biden's hard drive available as some sort of oppo project. \"But at the end of the day, the only real question is whether or not the emails are real and if they were composed by Hunter Biden. Neither Hunter nor his father's campaign has once tried to deny the authenticity of the emails. And the previously mentioned confirmation offered by other recipients of the messages pretty much seals the deal.\n\nEven if the information had been hacked, that would not make it inauthentic. The reason hacking is a serious offense that causes humiliation and wreaks financial and privacy havoc is because it exposes true information. The hacked Democratic National Committee emails were a problem for Democrats in 2016 because they were real. Media outlets published stories about them, and the Obama administration confronted the Russian regime over them, because the emails were authentic. Hacking is a bad thing. But there's nothing about it that makes the stolen information suspect. \"The Biden campaign's initial reaction was to check the former vice president's official calendar\u2014after which the campaign first lamely said there was no notation of any such meeting, and then meekly admitted that Biden might well have met with the Burisma executive. But notice what they didn't say: Nobody claimed there was no need to check any official calendar because the email was a fake. They assumed it was authentic, because there was no good reason not to. At the moment, the known evidence overwhelmingly tends to establish that the laptop is exactly what it is represented to be: the repository of Hunter Biden's authentic emails, documents, photos, and videos.\"\n\nAccording to the emails, both Bidens were in line in 2017 to benefit from a deal with CEFC.

What, precisely, was the role of Pozharskyi? What was he working on? What of the computer that the email was recovered from? (It was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop and supposedly belongs to Hunter Biden.) And what did the New York Post know about all this? Not enough to satisfy New York Post journalists, apparently. As reported by Katie Robertson of the New York Times, the story's main author, veteran staffer Bruce Golding, declined to attach his byline to the piece over credibility concerns, as did at least one colleague. According to the Times, one of the bylined authors\u2014Gabrielle Fonrouge\u2014learned that she'd been credited only after the story was published. The other by-line belongs to Emma-Jo Morris, who had no previous New York Post bylines.\n\nThe Biden campaign denied that any substantive meeting occurred between the then-vice president and claims that there are no records of it. Biden's foreign policy and energy advisers also said that they'd never heard of Pozharskyi; there's a possibility, perhaps, that the Ukrainian executive briefly met Biden at a public event, several of which were scheduled for the vice president on the day in question. (Hunter Biden had previously arranged for a potential business partner from China to shake hands with his father in the lobby of a Beijing hotel.) But so far, it doesn't look like the meeting described in this email happened at all.\n\nThere are also strong indicators that Russia had something to do with this whole affair, though nothing has surfaced definitively proving this is the case. In January, the same Russian intelligence unit that hacked Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic National Committee's emails in 2016 was also able to infiltrate Burisma's systems. U.S. intelligence analysts subsequently picked up chatter indicating that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked as part of an October surprise aimed at influencing the election.

But motherhood is inextricably linked to biological sex. Gender and sexual orientation are not. \"The good textualist is not a literalist,\" Justice Scalia once wrote. The majority here isn't merely applying an overly broad or vague law, which Justice Gorsuch has criticized the Court for doing in other cases. The Court is redefining the original meaning of 'sex' in the law. \"If Justice Gorsuch can use textualism to rewrite a statute to comport with changing public mores, then it is meaningless. Textualism becomes merely one more tool of those who believe in a 'living Constitution' that means whatever any Justice says it means.\" Justice Gorsuch has defined his own jurisprudence down.\n\nFor decades, courts rightly interpreted 'sex' discrimination in Title VII as prohibiting employers from treating women worse than men because they are women and vice versa. Rewriting the law to include 'gender identity' as a protected status should be a power held solely by the legislative branch, and Congress has declined to make this change multiple times. The same is true about adding 'sexual orientation' to Title VII. Again, Congress has repeatedly rejected adding that classification to Title VII. \"This very point was recognized earlier in Zarda's litigation by Judge Gerard Lynch, an Obama appointee on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Lynch supports adding at least one LGBT classification to Title VII as a matter of policy. Yet he did not interpret the law that way, saying: 'I would be very pleased to awake to learn that Congress had secretly passed such legislation more than a half century ago\u2014until I actually woke up. Because we all know that Congress did no such thing.'\n\nTo say that because sexual orientation is related to sex, it is the same thing as sex, is as nonsensical as saying that a square and a rectangle are the same thing for painting purposes because both have four sides. Laws should be interpreted according to the generally understood and understandable public meaning at the time they were adopted. Otherwise, the meaning of laws might change willy-nilly. All this is important because radically new interpretations of existing phrases can lead to unforeseen consequences.

Chris and the employer had communicated by text and email, but never met in person or talked by phone. Chris often has referred to a husband in discussing evening or weekend plans. When Chris and the employer meet, the employer is surprised that Chris is male. The employer fires Chris, saying that he does not want to employ gay people. If Chris were female, Chris would still have the job. That, by definition, is employment discrimination because of sex.\n\nThe scope and thus the impact of this decision is hard to overstate, aside from the immediate protections it offers for \"approximately 1 million workers who identify as transgender and 7.1 million lesbian, gay and bisexual workers.\" Among other things, it will likely doom new proposed regulations from the Trump administration stripping health-care protections from transgender individuals, since it was explicitly based on Justice Alito's rejected interpretation of the language of discrimination according to sex. Politically, the fact that Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, wrote this decision could be ominous for the president.\n\nThe ruling is a bracing defeat for social conservatives, the Trump administration, and the conservative legal movement. Legal conservatives have long justified their support for Trump by citing his success at placing like-minded jurists on the federal bench, with Gorsuch as the foremost example of their victory. Monday's ruling suggests that the reliably conservative Supreme Court majority sought for so long by right-wing legal activists may not be quite as reliable as it seems\u2014and that their moral and ethical sacrifices to pursue it may have been in vain.\n\nThis watershed ruling implicitly recognizes that rights such as gay marriage may ring hollow if one can be fired for exercising them. And it represents a historic judicial affirmation of the dignity and equality of transgender persons. \"Gorsuch simply accepts the experience and humanity of transgender people as a given, affirming their place in our society.\" Gorsuch does not hesitate in correctly referring to Aimee Stephens\u2014the transgender plaintiff\u2014as \"she.\" This may seem like a simple gesture. Yet it stands as a towering rebuke of judges who have recently issued decisions that cruelly misgender transgender plaintiffs.

It's undeniable, however, that the 2020 polling, taken in its totality, doesn't look good for Trump right now.\n\nThe head-to-head polling doesn't really tell us much about events 18 months in the future, but it does tell us there's no counterintuitive process whereby Trump secures the votes of tons of people who say he's doing a bad job as president. The public is mostly saying they want to vote for any Democrat, and the strongest pattern so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than the more obscure ones.

Trump's EO is merely an extension of longstanding bipartisan policy that suggests that Jews ought to be protected on college campuses by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 'Even if the EO had labeled Jews a 'nationality,' that would have been perfectly in line with Jewish law and tradition. Jews are not merely a religious group. They are in fact a group with shared ancestry, a shared culture, and a shared history. You can join the group by converting, but while religious and philosophic Judaism is a key component of Jewish identity---and the most key component when it comes to standing to speak on Jewish issues, generally---Jewishness isn't just religion.\n\nThis is one of those journalistic errors that would not have been made if not for the left-leaning media's pre-existing hostility to Trump. If the Times had been told a similar story about an EO to be issued by President Obama (and this appears to be based on Obama-era policy), the paper would have carefully checked the 'nationality' claim before printing it. But because Trump is presumed to have bad intent at all times, they ran with an explosive claim that wasn't true. Great work, guys! I wonder why so many Americans don't trust the media?\n\nTrump's EO 'Combating Anti-Semitism' arrives as antisemitism continues to proliferate on college campuses, largely under the guise of 'anti-Zionism.' Just a few weeks ago, a former Israeli soldier arrived at Vassar to deliver a speech and was met by raucous protesters from the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. The crowd enthusiastically chanted, 'from the river to the sea,' a popular anti-Zionist refrain that advocates for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the nation of Israel.

But it is also a sign that the Trump administration might be willing to expand ongoing efforts to attack the speech rights of Palestinians on campus, an extension of an illiberal trend in organized pro-Israel advocacy that should trouble all of us. \"The Trump Department of Education has already launched several investigations into pro-Palestinian campus speech under the auspices of Title VI. It's possible this could escalate after the executive order.\" In the last year alone, the Department of Education has launched investigations into alleged anti-Semitism at Rutgers University, Duke University, the University of North Carolina, and Williams College. If found to have enabled anti-Semitism on campus, these universities could forfeit millions of dollars in federal funding. Yet, in each case, the 'anti-Semitic' speech being investigated is criticism of Israel.\n\nMr. Trump's executive order points agencies to the definition of anti-Semitism prepared by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. This definition includes several examples of speech that should be covered by the First Amendment, like 'claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.' For this reason, Kenneth Stern, the lead author of the definition, wrote in The Times that it shouldn't be applied to higher education. The agency's definition was prepared for data collectors writing reports in Europe, not for government officials policing campus speech.\n\nSome, however, note that \"The order only directs agencies to consider the IHRA's list 'to the extent that any examples might be useful as evidence of discriminatory intent.'\" In other words, applying double standards to Israel alone would not trigger a Title VI investigation.

Proportionally, Israel's campaign has exceeded the destruction of the Allied bombings of Germany in World War II.\n\nU.S. intelligence estimated that 40 to 45 percent of the 29,000 bombs Israel had dropped were unguided, prone to cause greater collateral damage. Indeed, an Israeli rear admiral acknowledged before the ground invasion began that while the Israel Defense Forces was \"balancing accuracy,\" right now, we're focused on what causes maximum damage.\"\n\nIsrael will one day have to ask itself whether it acted appropriately in the heat of its anger and sorrow after Oct. 7.\n\nThe words of Israeli officials are being offered as evidence of intent: from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging Israelis to \"remember\" the Old Testament account of the carnage of Amalek (\"Spare no one, but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings,\" reads one passage) to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowing that \"Gaza won't return to what it was before---we will eliminate everything\" to the minister of energy and infrastructure pledging, \"They will not receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave this world.\"\n\nI have heard many people balk at the suggestion that Gaza could be experiencing genocide. The Holocaust, after all, wiped out over 60 percent of European Jews. Israel's war---instigated, no less, by the murder of Jews---has killed about 1 percent of the Palestinians in Gaza. One percent is terrible, of course, but genocide? Under the genocide convention, though, the term describes an intent to wipe out a defined group of people and taking steps to achieve that end. There is no threshold of death or proportion of death that must be reached.\n\nOthers argue, \"there is no evidence that Israeli forces have engaged in a deliberate campaign to 'destroy, in whole or in part,' the Palestinian people---which is what 'genocide' means in international law.\" Awful as the civilian deaths in Gaza have been, they still constitute less than 1 percent of the territory's population.

By all accounts, including South Africa's, Israel has the undeniable military capability to completely destroy the entire Gaza Strip in a matter of minutes if it so desired. Notably, Israel has not done so, and instead has taken extreme measures to protect Gazan civilians.\n\nThe entire context of Israel's military response is completely, indefensibly, ignored; nowhere does the application even consider the possibility that Israel's actions are lawful under the doctrines of, say, military necessity, proportionality, force protection, or deterrence in responding to a terrorist organization. Yes, blockades and sieges could be war crimes\u2014but they aren't in this case; both the Geneva and Hague Conventions include instructions on conducting sieges under international law, and Israel has followed those rules to the letter.\n\nIn recent decades, as many as three million people perished in a famine in North Korea that was mainly government-induced. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians were gassed, bombed, starved, or tortured to death by the Assad regime, and an estimated 14 million were forced to flee their homes. China has put more than a million Uyghurs through gulag-like re-education camps.\n\nBut North Korea, Syria, and China have never been charged with genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel has. The war between Israel and Hamas is terrible\u2014as is every war. But if this is genocide, what word do we have for the killing fields in Cambodia, Stalin's Holodomor in Ukraine, the Holocaust itself?\n\nIf Israel were trying to commit genocide, it wouldn't be putting its soldiers at risk or allowing humanitarian relief to arrive from Egypt or withdrawing many of its forces from Gaza. It would simply be killing Palestinians everywhere, in vastly greater numbers, as Germans killed Jews or Hutus killed Tutsis.\n\nBut arguing the merits presumes this case is more than political theater. South Africa sees U.N. grandstanding as a way to curry favor with Russia, China, and Iran, which are eager to reduce Western influence. Where was South Africa's moral outrage when the country tolerated Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe, or when it opposed the indictment of Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir for killing some 200,000 people in Darfur?\n\nIf the U.N. wants to find genocidal intent, try the"

And she implemented what was ultimately ruled to be an unlawful policy to prevent immigrants from applying for asylum if they entered the country illegally. But Nielsen drew the line at Trump's 'clearly illegal' demands, including 'blocking all migrants from seeking asylum.' She also reportedly refused to resume family separations, despite Trump's entreaties, because she did not want to violate a court order.

Ms. Nielsen wasn't responsible for the surge of Central American migrants arriving at the border to claim political asylum, but Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress both needed a fall guy.

More important, Grenell himself has said he will only be acting director, and that he expects the president will soon nominate someone else for the position. Intelligence assessments involve the input of 16 agencies and often take months to complete, so it would be near impossible for someone serving as acting director for a short period of time to suppress or alter intelligence products. \"So appointing Grenell may be less an effort to censor intelligence than a bit of hostage politics with the Senate.
