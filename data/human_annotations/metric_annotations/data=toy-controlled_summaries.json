            "The talking point President Donald Trump and top administration officials are using to explain the abrupt dismissal of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire---namely, that his dismissal was required by law---doesn't add up. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien claimed Maguire had to go because he couldn't serve as acting director of national intelligence past March 11 due to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But Maguire could've stayed on as acting director of national intelligence indefinitely had Trump nominated someone to become Senate-confirmed before March 11. 'Also, if the Trump administration is really concerned about the March 11 cutoff, then appointing Grenell to the acting role won't address it, as he now faces the same deadline that Maguire did before his dismissal. Maguire's ouster may be part of Trump's broader effort to get rid of government officials he perceives as being insufficiently loyal.",
            "The New York Times reports that Trump was angry at Maguire because he was afraid Democrats would use the information about Russian interference against him. And I suppose he's right. Another alternative, of course, would be for Trump to do something about Russian interference, which would neuter any possible Democratic complaints. Apparently, though, that's out of the question. Don't you know there's an election coming up? 'Kevin Drum, Mother Jones",
            "Russian election meddling is not the only area where Trump doesn't want to hear the conclusions of his top spies. For weeks now, officials in the country's intelligence agencies, and in oversight committees on Capitol Hill, have been trying to determine the fate of the intelligence community's annual Worldwide Threat Assessment. as it has in past years, it contains the conclusion that Russia, not Ukraine, meddled in the 2016 U. S. elections in an effort to help Trump, and is doing so again this year. But as past ones have, this year's assessment also contains other conclusions that are at odds with the president. 'Officials familiar with the document say it contradicts Trump's stated positions on: the likelihood of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons program; the prospects that a 'maximum pressure' campaign will force Iran to abandon its nuclear efforts; whether ISIS remains a threat; and climate change as a threat to national security. The effort to block the release of the threat assessment cuts against more than a decade of increased transparency during which the report has been made public in redacted form.",
            "Regarding Grenell, 'he has little intelligence experience and has never run a large bureaucracy. Before he was dispatched to Berlin, he worked as a public affairs consultant and commentator for Fox News. Before that, he was a communications official in President George W. Bush's administration. He has been an aggressive public cheerleader for Mr. Trump, fiercely and frequently defending him on Fox News and on social media. That appears to be the qualification that truly matters to this president---especially when it comes to overseeing an intelligence community that Mr. Trump has always believed has been out to get him. 'Presidents have tended to shy away from politicizing national intelligence---or at least tried to avoid the perception of such politicization. But Mr. Trump has made clear that he will not tolerate any discussion of Russia's meddling in American politics, no matter how compelling the evidence. He is sending a very public message: In this White House, protecting Donald Trump's interests is what matters.",
            "The DNI must be seen as a neutral arbiter among America's vast intelligence community that ranges from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) to the FBI, DEA and intelligence units of the Departments of State, Energy, Homeland Security and Treasury. He or she must be a mediator, bringing often-conflicting people and ideas together to reach a consensus or at least a viable menu of choices for the president's final decision on life-or-death matters. But above all, this individual must be deeply conversant with the arcane language and practices, sources and methods that make up the core mission of the intelligence communities. Rick Grenell brings none of this to the table.",
            "Our allies won't trust us if our own officers face constant pressure to politicize intelligence. That means reporting streams will dry up, we won't get early warning on planned attacks and we will lose critical knowledge about the decisions adversaries are making that may not have consequences today, but could have huge ones in the next decade. It's impossible to know how many clues we will miss if our intelligence community is isolated from the world and the president's daily brief only reinforces what the administration wants to hear. I hope Mr. Grenell makes a careful assessment of the intelligence community's capacities and impressive work force before making further changes. How dangerous it would be if we lose the tip of the spear against those who would destroy us."

            "Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. 'A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn't changed since late April. More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.",
            "Although the true number of unemployed people is a matter of debate, the data show that as many as 27. 5 percent of Americans lost their job or had their hours scaled back as a result of the shutdowns. That's more than 30 million Americans, at a minimum, who were hit hard economically. We simply cannot sustain that level of economic catastrophe much longer. 'Rises in the coronavirus infection and hospitalization rates have to be put into context. We must minimize the potential loss of life, but public health measures must also be weighed against the cost of millions of ruined lives. Keeping the economy closed and the lockdowns tight would be fatal to America itself. To do this would be the public health equivalent of the famous quote from a dispatch during the Vietnam War: 'It was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it. ",
            "Maximum lockdowns were never a realistic long-term option. The end of our patience was never going to coincide with the end of the pandemic. Yes, warmer weather will probably help some, along with more Americans spending more time outdoors. In some parts of the country, lots of people are still wearing masks; in other parts of the country, not so much. Ending idiotic policies about returning still-contagious patients to nursing homes will help reduce the death rate considerably. 'But. the virus is still out there. The fact that people would rather play out an American version of China's Cultural Revolution, complete with public 'struggle sessions,  or go over footage of a cop shoving a senior citizen in Buffalo like it's the Zapruder film, or remove the television show Cops from the airwaves---because having camera crews ride along with police officers is somehow enabling police brutality---does not change any facts about the virus and its spread.",
            "The coronavirus has not disappeared, and the rules governing our response to it are still being applied to businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations. In Maryland, for example, outdoor religious services have been banned completely by Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich. And my church in northern Virginia has decided to hold off on in-person services, outdoors or indoors, because the regulations are too vague and too difficult to navigate. Where were these regulations during Saturday's protest? . 'Government officials cannot selectively restrict constitutional rights. Either the law applies to everyone, or it doesn't apply at all. In other words, if protesters have the right to gather, churches should have that right as well. Any other application of the law is hypocritical and unconstitutional.",
            "With coronavirus, government has been aggressive to excessive. When business owners have attempted to reopen ahead of government timelines, many have faced harsh responses. Government actions and reactions have been aimed at normal activities by otherwise law-abiding citizens. Meanwhile, government has been permissive to passive (at least initially) with protests. Here, government action has not been taken against people gathering en masse in violation of health orders, even when some of those protests turned to violent riots. 'The danger Democrats increasingly face is that Middle America and moderate voters will see these increasingly stark juxtapositions. Democrats need protests to end now---yesterday actually. The longer they last, the worse Democrats look, and the greater the likelihood that Middle America and moderate voters make a connection from current chaos, to coronavirus, to leftward campaign content---and break with Democrats."

            "I would not say that any of the candidates had a breakout moment or a great zinger, but none of them suffered a huge mistake either. I don't expect that anyone will move up or down in the polls very much based on their performance tonight. Sanders took more hits than he did last time, but not as many as I thought he would. Warren still pulled her punches, saying only that she could get things done better than Bernie. Klobuchar said pretty much the same thing. Bloomberg hit Bernie hard early on, but I'm not sure anyone noticed.",
            "Compared to her treatment of Bloomberg Warren treaded much more lightly with Sanders, although she did draw more of a contrast with him than she has in the past. 'Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie,  she said, explaining that she's had more success in the fights she's waged, such as pushing for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She said their plans for Medicare for All were similar, but his 'doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.  'I dug in,  Warren continued. 'I did the work, and then Bernie's team trashed me for it. We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done.  It was a clear shot, but like so many of the attacks leveled against Sanders tonight, it was a glancing blow. For Warren, as for the others, it might have come too late.",
            "By far Sanders's most vulnerable moment came when Norah O'Donnell brought up Sanders's kind words for Cuban literacy programs. Like many leftists, Sanders expressed heavily caveated solidarity for leftist regimes like Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s, especially when those regimes were being threatened by right-wing authoritarian movements backed by the US. 'Sanders gave a satisfactory explanation of his comments on Cuba, situating them in the context of former President Barack Obama's historic opening to the country. 'Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba. I said what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education,  Sanders said. 'Occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran.  'Being honest' about topics that politicians aren't typically honest about is at the core of Sanders's appeal as a candidate, and he showed he could take the same approach when asked about Cuba. It was a good audition for the general, and crucially for a frontrunner, he did no harm to his standing in the primary.",
            "Meanwhile, 'Mayor Pete made a solid, regular case for just about every solid, regular subject. If this were a contest in sounding reasonable, then Buttigieg would run away with the contest. But the metronomic mayor regulates his beat a little too precisely to have a true pulse. Yes, he admitted, there was a progressive majority. 'But, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.  It takes a peculiar love of reason to think you can campaign against passion by pushing for lower blood pressure. Don't get too excited now.",
            "Some argue that 'The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor was at his absolute best in this debate. He found several occasions to make direct contrasts with Bernie Sanders -- most notably on the dangers for Democrats of nominating a democratic socialist and the differences in their health care plans -- which is a win in and of itself. Buttigieg also flashed a sense of humor when plugging his website to encourage donations, which was a welcome moment of levity in a debate defined by people shouting at one another at very close range. If voters were looking for a Sanders alternative who looked like he could be commander in chief in this debate, Buttigieg made a very good case for himself.",
            "Finally, 'By the metrics of shoring up his base, Biden did well. He was forceful and on message. He won much applause for his promise to appoint an African American woman to the Supreme Court. He kept alluding to his record as Obama's vice president and his experience on the world stage. Biden made the case for himself as a tough, experienced, and trustworthy leader."

            "'Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.  Those are the damning words of President Trump's handpicked ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who on Wednesday morning directly implicated not only Mr. Trump, but also several top members of his administration. 'Mr. Trump claims that he did nothing wrong, yet the White House refuses to let most of these people appear under oath. (Mr. Sondland himself defied orders not to testify from the White House and the State Department. ) It's worth emphasizing this point: All the witnesses whose testimony has been damaging to Mr. Trump have given that testimony under oath. All of those who we are led to believe would exonerate the president have so far refused to testify. If Mr. Trump truly believes he insisted on no conditions for the White House meeting and the aid for Ukraine, he has a clear choice: Let people testify. At this point it's hard to see what reason they have for continuing to refuse.",
            "The president's defenders have leaned into a version of Nunes's argument that Trump was just very interested in rooting out Ukrainian corruption. According to this line of argument, Trump's interest onlycoincidentally happened to dovetail with an investigation of his possible chief political rival in the 2020 election and in a conspiracy theory that might damage the results of the Mueller investigation. Sondland's testimony, though, demonstrates that even if you wanted to accept this absurd premise, the evidence and testimony don't show Trump seeking any sort of genuine investigation. Instead, according to Sondland, he strictly wanted the announcement of one. 'As others in the impeachment inquiry have previously testified, if Trump actually wanted an investigation of corruption by American citizens, then the Department of Justice was the appropriate place for that to start. If the DOJ needed help from the Ukrainians to conduct such a legitimate investigation, they could request that help through what's called a mutual legal assistance treaty. None of that ever happened. Instead, there were secret back-channels and deals and demands. As we continue to learn, a legitimate investigation was never what Trump wanted. What he wanted was help in his reelection campaign, and he was willing to leverage America's national security to get it.",
            "Zelensky 'had to announce the investigations,  Sondland said, referring to the probes into Biden's family and the 2016 election. 'He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it.  Legal experts previously told CNN that this is a critical distinction. Most legitimate investigations are done in secret, so as not to tip off the supposed criminals. But the intense focus on securing a public announcement from Zelensky demonstrates that the scheme was really designed to maximize the political benefit to Trump, instead of a good-faith effort to investigate corruption.",
            "The GOP defense is now this: Trump is exonerated, because it hasn't yet been nailed down beyond any doubt that Trumpdirectly commanded Sondland to tell Ukraine that the money was withheld for that corrupt purpose. Sondland unequivocally confirmed that Trump was using the White House meeting as leverage to get the investigations he wanted, and that numerous top officials were in on that corrupt scheme. Now that it has been established that Trump dangled a meeting to force an investigation of Biden, how likely is it that Trump suddenly didn'tintend to use the frozen military aid for that same purpose, at precisely the moment he was bothobsessing over that goal and was maximizing his leverage over Ukraine to its highest point yet?",
            "The hearings have demonstrated in detail the extent to which Trump conflates his personal grudges with America's interests, even when the former harms the latter, and how he allows those private grudges to dictate foreign policy decisions that impact multiple countries. A foreign policy driven by a person unwilling to govern his feelings, subordinate his grudges, or follow rules is not a policy at all. It's a puff of air, a set of whims. It's a vague hunch his yay-sayers must interpret and try to execute, and apologize for when he changes his mind and blames them for getting it wrong.",
            "There are many pundits who will opine that removing a president is divisive and unprecedented. It is true that no president has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process. But that just speaks to how rare it has been for a president to even get to the point we are at now. And while it is certainly true that there are people who would be upset by his removal from office, the far greater risk lies in allowing this president, with this explicitly illegal, immoral and unjust track record of abusing the power of his office for his personal electoral benefit, to participate in future elections. Doing so would deprive the people of their constitutional right to choose their leader in a free, open and fair election."

            "New hot spots are emerging in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. Some of that spike is probably the result of more testing. But what's so concerning is that the positive test rate is also increasing at the same time, up from less than 8 percent at the end of May to nearly 14 percent now. It is difficult to ignore that the places seeing surges in Covid-19 cases began to reopen businesses and other public spaces a few weeks ago. 'The nationwide protests over George Floyd's death, police violence, and structural racism have also been met with concerns that they would become superspreading events. According to the experts I spoke with, however, it is simply too early to know whether the coronavirus will spread widely because of the protests. And it is worth remembering the differences between outdoor and indoor exposure, the latter being much more dangerous; it could end up being the case that people got infected because they were arrested and put into a police van or jail cell with other people, not because they were outside protesting in a big crowd.",
            "Some argue that 'I've been a vocal supporter of these protests from their start. But what we should not tolerate, and what the scientific community cannot permit if it is to retain its credibility, is the abuse and manipulation of health expertise for political ends. One of two things is true; either 1) these protests will lead to a significant spike in coronavirus infections and deaths, in which case public health experts should reconcile that outcome with how they could have encouraged and endorsed them; or 2) it will not lead to such a spike, in which case it will appear that the months of extreme, draconian lockdowns---which caused great suffering and deprivation around the world---were excessive, misguided and unwarranted.",
            "Others note that 'The people who are marching in the streets right now are well aware of the risk of coronavirus transmission. They are not acting out of ignorance that needs to be corrected by public-health experts. As one protester in Minneapolis said, 'Yes, corona is happening. It's real, it's deadly. But racism kills way more lives'. Even if public-health experts did want to stop the protests, they almost certainly could not. Any public-health pronouncements to the hundreds of thousands of people marching around the U. S. and worldwide would be like shouting into a mighty wind. 'Many experts, and some public-health officials, have adopted a harm-reduction approach to the protests, accepting that they must happen and offering recommendations to help people protest as safely as possible. Others have gone further by handing out masks and other protective gear on-site. The decision reflects what public-health experts have always tried to do: maximize the health of the population across all aspects of life.",
            "Experts never said that eternal lockdowns were the only choice we had to combat the pandemic. They argued that once areas got the initial case spikes under control through widespread social distancing (with new cases decreasing over at least a two-week span), a new phase of control should begin with widespread testing and contact tracing. The initial lockdown period avoided the worst possible scenario, but the US didn't use that time to prepare for managing the pandemic in the future. And now we've wasted the weeks that have passed since reopening. 'We managed to disrupt our economy and skyrocket unemployment, and we didn't control the damn virus,  said Jeff Shaman, an infectious disease modeler at Columbia University.",
            "Our current vaccine production infrastructure is already strained and. building new infrastructure is both expensive and complicated. It costs anywhere from $50 to $700 million to build a new facility and takes years to complete. Existing production facilities are highly specialized for making a single, specific type of vaccine, like polio or measles, and they are currently reserved to make those vaccines. If those facilities are repurposed to make a new COVID-19 vaccine, it will put the supply of other critical vaccines at risk. 'In addition, shortages of supplies like syringes and vials could delay the delivery of current vaccines and a future COVID-19 vaccine. Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that there are only 200 million vials left in the world because they've all been bought up. Operation Warp Speed is a fantastic goal. It needs a plan to match it."

            "The Democratic contenders finally realized that they need to aim their fire at Bernie Sanders, rather than on their fellow trailers. Even Buttigieg and Kloubuchar were able to resist skewering each other. Only Elizabeth Warren seems not to have received the memo. She continued to savage Michael Bloomberg. Why she thinks this will help salvage her failing campaign is beyond me. 'As for the attacks on Sanders, I question whether they will set him back much. For one thing, most of the attacks centered on electability. The argument wasn't so much that Sanders is wrong on policy, but rather that the boldness of his proposals make him unelectable and will bring down Democratic congressional candidates. Sanders deflected this line of attack by citing polls that show him running ahead of President Trump. Moreover, many Democrats admire Sanders for his boldness, just as they did in 2016.",
            "Another reason Sanders made it through the night: the nature of the criticisms of him. Attacking him from the left, as Biden did on guns, may score a debate point but isn't going to convince people that Biden is the more committed progressive. Sanders owns that territory. While Biden's attack on Sanders over his praise for the Cuban government was correct in its gist---he has been an apologist and contextualizer for left-wing dictators---the details were mistaken and won't hold up as the argument is litigated in coming days. Like Donald Trump in 2016, Sanders is also in the enviable position of being able to tell the voters he's courting that all the attacks on him are just proof that he is upsetting the establishment. 'For the most part, Sanders was able to avoid getting stuck defending himself. He answered nearly every criticism by returning to a familiar riff about billionaires. (He's against them. ) That tack won't work if he's the nominee. Voters at large are much more hostile to socialism, at home and abroad, than Democratic voters are. But it was enough to keep him just as secure in the front-runner position as he was at the start of the night.",
            "Pete Buttigieg got off the best line when he said Sanders has 'nostalgia for the revolution politics of the '60s.  He was the only candidate on the stage who had a strategy to try and derail Sanders's momentum. He did what he could. But everybody else was just so lousy at it. Or, in the case of Warren, too wrapped up in her misty water-colored memories of her triumph over Bloomberg last week to pay attention to the guy who is actually eating her lunch---the guy who has every reason to think (no matter what happens in South Carolina) that he is heading inexorably for the center stage in Milwaukee.",
            "There were three moments over the course of the night when Sanders and Buttigieg clashed in a serious, sustained way. In the first two, Buttigieg tried to make his point with the sort of rational 'Let's talk about that' lines that are his hallmark. And Sanders shouted at himover and over. Until Buttigieg eventually gave up and let Sanders have the floor. The third time this happened, Buttigieg forged ahead and didn't back down. But because he wasn't willing to raise his voice, Sanders shouted over him and drowned him out. This is Bernie's move. It's how he deals with being challenged. But ask yourself: Do you think Sanders is going to be better at dominance politics than Trump is? Because I'm not sure I'd like his chances in that matchup. 'Biden was feisty and sharp. He showed voters that he's a fighter and emphasized over and over the idea of getting things done. He hit Bernie early for having wanted to primary Barack Obama in 2012 and had a great line when asked about his support from African-Americans: 'I don't expect anything. I'm here to earn the vote. At this point, Biden is a clear underdog. But he sure looks like the strongest challenger to Sanders.",
            "Finally, 'Mike Bloomberg cleared the exceptionally low bar of, 'better than last week.  He had some painfully unfunny planned jokes that landed with a thud, and when the topics turned to his weaknesses like stop-and-frisk and nondisclosure agreements with former employees, he looked tense. But Bloomberg had some good moments, and he's getting a bit more comfortable as the capitalist defender of charter schools and skeptic on marijuana legalization. The mood of the rest of the field is forcing Bloomberg to be the contrarian, which fits him. Bloomberg has few problems that can't be mitigated by another couple hundred million in television ads."

            "The scale of the clash shouldn't be exaggerated. But the Trump-DeSantis storyline is inherently alluring. Some version of what DeSantis represents has the greatest odds of coaxing the party away from Trump and forging a new political synthesis that bears the unmistakable stamp of Trump while jettisoning his flaws. 'This critique of Trump wouldn't be that he tweeted foolish things or violated norms or disgraced himself after the 2020 election. It would be, for example, that he elevated Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, early in the pandemic and listened to his advice for too long. 'The case against Trump would be that, despite all his talk of building the border wall, he didn't get it done and left a desperately flawed immigration system intact, even though he had two years of a Republican Congress. That he rattled China's cage but didn't make fundamental changes to the U. S. trading relationship and said things that were much too complimentary of President Xi Jinping. That, finally, he lost to Joe Biden, a desperately flawed candidate who only made it into the White House because Trump made himself so unpopular.",
            "For the duration of the response, DeSantis always took the lead in announcing Covid policy. Trump outsourced his Covid policymaking to Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the healthcare bureaucracy. By the time it went sidewaysbecause it solely focused on eradicating a virus that was never getting eliminatedit was too late. The media was solidly on the side of Fauci and Birx simply because their narrative opposed Trump's. 'Now rather than giving the media (that he supposedly detests) fodder to divide Republicans by making every member of the GOP take a side, maybe Trump should knock it off. There is an election in 2022 before anyone needs to worry about 2024. Plus, he's getting in the age range where buying green bananas is risky. Perhaps he should consider taking on the role of the America First kingmaker rather than sending the country careening toward a grudge match with Hillary Clinton in 2024. Trump's pride and need for fealty do not supersede the need to maintain GOP leadership in Florida and retake the House to end the disastrous Biden agenda. 'Stacey Lennox, PJ MediaOthers note, 'I called former national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, who has been down to Mar-a-Lago and on the phone with the former president. Had he heard this chatter? O'Brien went on the record: 'I've never heard any such thing,  he declared on my radio show Thursday. I also checked in with longtime DeSantis supporters. Sources close to the governor confirm O'Brien's account: 'There is no conflict. Zero tension. 'Addiction is a terrible thing to break, and Trump addiction is particularly strong among scribblers and talking heads. But, as for the alleged feud, as Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, there's no there there. Yes, everyone would like to have a do-over on virus response. DeSantis's musings about what he might have done differently in 2020 got catapulted from a serious reflection by a serious man into a tawdry bit of nonnews, especially compared to the real deal of 'minor incursion.

            "Some news outlets view a trove of stolen emails and photographs as the starting point for an investigation; other news outlets view the same material as something worthy of nearly immediate publication. Like all slapdash political scandal stories, the New York Post's version leaves the reader with more questions than answers. 'Did the 'opportunity' turn into an actual meeting? What, precisely, was the role of Pozharskyi? What was he working on? What of the computer that the email was recovered from? (It was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop and supposedly belongs to Hunter Biden. ) And what did the New York Post know about all this? . 'Not enough to satisfy New York Post journalists, apparently. As reported by Katie Robertson of the New York Times, the story's main author, veteran staffer Bruce Golding, declined to attach his byline to the piece over credibility concerns, as did at least one colleague. According to the Times, one of the bylined authors---Gabrielle Fonrouge---learned that she'd been credited only after the story was published. The other by-line belongs to Emma-Jo Morris, who had no previous New York Post bylines.",
            "The Biden campaign denied that any substantive meeting occurred between the then-vice president and claims that there are no records of it. Biden's foreign policy and energy advisers also said that they'd never heard of Pozharskyi; there's a possibility, perhaps, that the Ukrainian executive briefly met Biden at a public event, several of which were scheduled for the vice president on the day in question. (Hunter Biden had previously arranged for a potential business partner from China to shake hands with his father in the lobby of a Beijing hotel. ) But so far, it doesn't look like the meeting described in this email happened at all. 'There are also strong indicators that Russia had something to do with this whole affair, though nothing has surfaced definitively proving this is the case. In January, the same Russian intelligence unit that hacked Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic National Committee's emails in 2016 was also able to infiltrate Burisma's systems. 'U. S. intelligence analysts subsequently picked up chatter indicating that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked as part of an October surprise aimed at influencing the election. Analysts were further concerned that forged materials might be included in the leaksomething that, without the original materials in question, journalists can't verify for themselves, leaving everyone to take the New York Post's word.",
            "So far, the Hunter Biden laptop affair is a farcical retread of the Russian hack-and-leak operation that helped torpedo Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations in 2016. Now, as then, the Trump campaign appears to be hoping that the media will dribble out stolen private messages over the final weeks of the campaign, creating an illusion of scandal where none exists. And now, as then, someone in Trump's inner circle is working directly with someone who is, at least according to the U. S. government, a Russian agent. 'The provenance of the alleged hard drive is murky, and the F. B. I. is reportedly investigating whether it's linked to a foreign disinformation campaign. Giuliani claims his lawyer got it from a Delaware computer repair shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, who says someone he thinks was Hunter Biden dropped off three laptops and never picked them up. Mac Isaac gave a halting interview to several journalists last week; The Daily Beast published the audio, so you can hear for yourself as his story shifts over the course of an hour. If there's an important story here, it's almost certainly about Giuliani's dirty tricks, not any wrongdoing by Joe Biden.",
            "What's clear, beyond the false scandal-mongering, has been evident for years: Hunter Biden made a mistake getting involved with a dubious company like Burisma. But the notion that the Burisma affair undermines Joe Biden's case to be president is, as he would say, malarkey. 'Joe Biden said in January it was a 'mistake' for his son to join the board, and promised that if he becomes president, none of his family members will have 'any involvement with any foreign government at all.  Hunter Biden, too, said he made a 'mistake' for which he bore 'full responsibility.  That's the sort of self-criticism we rarely hear from Trump or his family. This is smoke without a fire.",
            "Much is unknown about the Trump family's business overseaspast and present. While serving in the White House, Ivanka obtained fast-track approval of trademarks in China for fashion gear, beauty services, and voting machines. (Yes, voting machines. ) She also received quick okays for trademarks in Japan. 'According to the New York Times, the tax records the paper unearthed reveal that Trump, in the first two years of his presidency, received millions of dollars from projects in foreign countries, including $1 million from Turkey, $3 million from the Philippines, and $2. 3 million from India. Has Trump been involved with those projects as president? Let's see all the emails. Last year, Donald Jr. visited Indonesia to work with a Indonesian billionaire on a hotel project for the family businessand declared there was no connection between this deal and his dad's foreign policy actions. (At one point, the project had Chinese financing. ) Let's see all the emails about this, too."

            "Daniel Fried, an Atlantic Council fellow and former top U. S. diplomat, said that, while he could have worded it differently, what Biden said was truthful, noting opposition figures like Alexei Navalny who have been targeted and Russia's invasion of Crimea. 'I have little sympathy for the Russian expressions of feigned outrage and a great deal of sympathy for President Biden who is making a point, and he is saying let's call things by their name,  Fried said. 'Biden's approach is seen in part as an effort to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who did not forcefully push back on Russia for interfering in U. S. elections. 'It means the tenor of the relations has changed. It means that we're not talking nice about Putin and the Kremlin anymore and were not papering over what they're doing,  said Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia under former President Obama. 'The Russians now will have to decide whether they want the tenor and the actual relationship to improve because they would have to stop all the things they are doing,  Farkas added.",
            "Over and over, Trump was presented with questions about the frequency with which critics of Putin met with untimely ends. And over and over, Trump demurred, either shrugging at others' concerns or equating Putin's behavior with that of the United States. 'He kills journalists that don't agree with him,  Joe Scarborough said to Trump. 'Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe,  Trump replied. 'Nobody has proven that he's killed anyone,  Trump said on ABC's 'This Week.  He offered an odd addendum: 'You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. It has not been proven that he's killed reporters. ",
            "Biden's conclusion is surely informed by the Kremlin's recent attempt to kill the Russian pro-democracy opposition figure Alexei Navalny last year and UK-based Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. Still, it's noteworthy to hear a president openly agree another world leader is a 'killer.  For example, when then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump the same question in 2017, Trump's response was: 'You think our country is so innocent?  and 'I do respect Putin. 'It's clear, then, that Biden is no fan of the Kremlin leader and is currently in no rush to improve US-Russia ties. However, he did conclude the Russia segment by noting both countries can work together when their interests align, citing the five-year extension of the New START nuclear arms control deal between the two countries earlier this year. Put together, the Biden administration will remain tough on Russia and Putin in particular. But if they can find areas of mutual interest, then Washington and Moscow might be able to put their differences aside---at least temporarily. 'Alex Ward, VoxSome note that, 'Generally speaking, when you call someone a killer, you follow it up with action, though as the recent case of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shows, that's not the case for everyone. Similarly to its handling of the investigation of MBS's role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration has declassified an intelligence finding that Russia's FSB security agency was behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has announced new sanctions against a number of Russian officials in response, but none targeting Putin himself. (The Russian president is in direct control of the FSB. ). 'Ultimately the 'killer' affair may have more to do with domestic politics in both countries than foreign policy. All Biden really did was repeat a story he's been telling for years, and concur with his own intelligence agencies' assessments of Putin's activities. But by choosing to do it, he did draw a contrast with Trump. 'The Trump years opened up a wide partisan gap in U. S. views on Putin, and it's hard to imagine Biden will suffer politically for criticizing the Russian leader, no matter how glibly. As for Putin, he's been using international crises to deflect attention from problems at home for decades now."

No one heard him order a quid pro quo, in which Ukraine would gin up 'dirt' on Joe Biden in exchange for US aid or a White House meeting. Not one offered a convincing reason why Trump's interest in having Ukraine probe potential corruption warrants impeachment, even if it was part of quid pro quo. Fact is, Ukrainians were involved in the 2016 election, particularly in the investigation into Paul Manafort. And payments to Biden's son Hunter by notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma do reek.",
            "The claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election 'is supported by significant evidence. It includes public professions of support for Clinton and opposition to Trump by Ukrainian officials. It includes acknowledgments by Ukrainian investigators that their Obama administration counterparts encouraged them to investigate Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bolstering this theory is the fact that Ukrainian officials leaked information damaging to Manafort (a ledger of payments, possibly fabricated) that forced Manafort's ouster from the Trump campaign, triggering waves of negative publicity. 'A Ukrainian court, in late 2018, concluded that two Ukrainian officials meddled in the election. And in 2018 House testimony, Nellie Ohr---who worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign opposition research firm that produced the lurid and discredited Steele dossier---conceded that a pro-Clinton Ukrainian legislator was a Fusion informant. When Republicans and most Trump supporters refer to evidence of Ukrainian collusion in the 2016 election, it is this collusion theory that they are speaking about. This theory is in no way mutually exclusive with the finding that Russia hacked the DNC accounts---it has nothing to do with the hacking. There is nothing illogical in believing both that Russia hacked the Democrats and that Ukraine supported the Democrats.",
            "Some agree that 'the Democrats have their quid pro quo. Even if Trump never explicitly stated that military aid was dependent on Ukraine's investigations, Sondland said that 'everyone was in the loop' and acted under the impression that that was, in fact, the situation. Sondland seems to be making a calculated bet that Trump won't walk away from impeachment unscathed. Just look at how many times he's changed his story. First, he insisted that there was no quid pro quo. Then, he admitted he had actually communicated the quid pro quo. And now, Sondland is throwing the White House under the bus and claiming that he knew of but was powerless to stop a quid pro quo. Sondland's testimony proves that Trump's motivations were personal and that the president did put U. S. national security interests at risk for the sake of political gain.",
            "Yet many argue that 'this isn't a quid pro quo that comes close to meeting the definition of bribery. It's another case of Mr. Trump's volatile policy-making based on personal impulse or prejudice, but it's not an impeachable offense. Sondland's account essentially confirms that Mr. Trump had a negative view of Ukraine, was reluctant to keep supplying U. S. aid, and asked Mr. Sondland and others to work with Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce that he was opening an anti-corruption probe. Democrats might have advanced their cause with hearings and a censure resolution. Instead, they have unleashed the dogs of impeachment without impeachable offenses."

'Even with widespread public cooperation, vaccinating a critical mass of Americans will take months. Meanwhile, there is much to do that could mitigate the effects of the crisis. Elected officials can build a financial bridge to a post-pandemic world and help tens of millions of Americans keep food on the table, a roof over their heads, their businesses in operation, and essential services functioning until the middle of 2021, when mass distribution of vaccines will finally begin to end this scourge. 'None of this isor should becontroversial. Elected officials came together across party lines to do all these things less than nine months ago. Yes, it cost an eye-popping amount of money.

Single tax filers received a $1, 200 rebate; married couples filing jointly received twice that; and every child added $500 to the rebate total.

'Pelosi and Schumer have now signaled that they will come down significantly from their earlier demands, which has been the biggest obstacle to the passage of a Phase 4 relief bill. Republicans need to wrap this up as quickly as possible to get funding in place for vaccine distribution, and everyone can go home for the Christmas holiday with a small win in their pocket after all.",

It is renewing many problematic programs fueled by the belief, I am sure, that the economy can stay on ice for months as long as it is sustained by government spending. I am sure the restaurants that benefited from PPP but have closed permanently have a different perspective on this issue. 'State revenues fell less than feared and are going up again. What's more, since 1975, the unemployment rate has averaged 6. 3 percent---it is forecast to be 6. 8 percent for November. I am sorry, but extending and expanding UI---at a scale that is out of whack with past expansions---when the unemployment rate is close to the historical average is simply wrong. 'Lastly 1. 7 percent of this bill---or $16 billion according to the COVID Framework document presented this morning---is specifically about manufacturing vaccines, distribution, and testing. If spending bills are a reflection of politicians' priorities, Americans are getting a clear signal that these politicians have incredibly messed-up priorities with very little focus on what should matter the most right now. This compromise is about business as usual. It's about spending money on the stuff politicians always want to spend money on. The fact that some Democrats are willing to spend less than they wanted and that Republicans are willing to spend more than they should is not noble. It's politics."

            "In an ominous report Wednesday, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg came in first in a poll in Arkansas. No one has yet assessed the sheer amount of money he is spending. He may spend more on Facebook than Klobuchar will spend on her entire campaign. 'But Bloomberg's problem was made vivid this week as his past comments about stop and frisk policing in Black neighborhoods received widespread condemnation. The massive, well-executed Bloomberg ad campaign may crash and burn on the reality of the true Bloomberg. As an old adage goes, the ads failed because they worked. A good ad campaign kills a bad product fast---because it gets more people to try it. Bloomberg may have a clever 'buy the White House' idea. But it may be that the country gets vaccinated by Bloomberg himself, and the billions he spends in the end can't move people once their minds are made up.",
            "Most critics argue the recording from 2015 will make it difficult for him to attract far-left liberals and black voters, and some think it could be fatal to his chances. I don't think that's true. He was a successful mayor without seriously compromising his blunt style, and New Yorkers generally liked that about him, even when they disagreed. 'Assuming the issue recedes, I think he has a good chance of landing the most important endorsement of all---Barack Obama's. The two have been allies, if not friends, and Obama did not endorse Bloomberg's black Democratic opponent in 2009, Bill Thompson, instead using an appearance with Bloomberg to call him an 'outstanding mayor'. Obama has let it be known that he does not want Bernie Sanders to get the party's nomination. If Bloomberg can manage to make himself Sanders' top opponent, it's easy to imagine Obama leading the establishment in backing him, which would go a long way toward securing the nomination.",
            "Some posit that 'There's a lot that can and should be said about Bloomberg's comments. First, the stop-and-frisk policy Bloomberg was advocating for was of questionable necessity. When New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio did away with the policy a few years ago, many conservatives expressed concern that de Blasio was effectively handicapping the city's law enforcement. But. crime in the city continued to decrease significantly---even without stop and frisk. 'And it should go without saying that Bloomberg is engaging in deliberate racial profiling and that this is wrong and shameful. This mindset should give any reasonable person pause, and it should call into question Bloomberg's ability to lead a diverse country that is already divided. With that said, the timing of when this audio was released reveals something about the Democratic Party and the war for the black vote among its presidential candidates.",
            "Others argue that 'There are some legitimate civil liberties concerns about 'stop-and-frisk', although living in a city the size of New York comes with some loss of personal freedoms. But the application of 'stop-and-frisk' was not motivated by race, it was motivated by policing where the crime is. It's was what Thomas Sowell called disparity rather than discrimination. There are electoral reasons conservatives might want to help paint Bloomberg as racist, even if they don't really believe it. This trolly approach with its healthy dose of schadenfreude is understandable, but it's also wrong. The larger opportunity here is to use this incident to expose how irrational leftist definitions of racism are.",
            "It is too bad that Bloomberg has to tar the Stop and Frisk program with such over the top generalizations of who commits murder. What Bloomberg also misses out on is that while there are good reasons to disarm criminals, poor minorities, the very people who are most likely victims of violent crime, are the ones who benefit the most from carrying concealed handguns. Bloomberg's claim doesn't distinguish between law-abiding blacks who want to protect themselves and the criminals. 'President Trump's moves on criminal justice reform, coupled with historically low minority unemployment rates, are already threatening to make inroads on minority voting. A Bloomberg nomination might make these inroads even greater and set the stage for a resounding electoral victory by Trump."

            "Critics have pejoratively described the bill as 'censorship,  but it is perfectly appropriate to censor adult themes and ideas around small children. Beyond teaching the acceptance of differences, why confuse children under eight years old, most of whom do not yet understand the biology of sexual reproduction? What need is there for schools to introduce young children to the highly contentious metaphysical claim that your sexed body may not be your 'true' gender? If parents wish to discuss these themes with their children, they are of course free to do so. 'These are not hypothetical concerns. In November, the Littlejohn family filed a lawsuit against Leon County School Board in federal district court in Northern Florida, after they were excluded from welfare decisions regarding their 13-year-old daughter. The Littlejohns had informed the school that their daughter was confused about her gender and made clear that they did not consent to social transition. 'However, it later transpired that school staff had held private meetings with her, asking which pronouns she would prefer, which restrooms she would like to use, whether she would like to stay with the boys on overnight trips, and whether they should keep her parents in the dark.",
            "Many parents believe that classroom teachers should not show young, impressionable children pictures that depict breast-binding or encourage physically altering their growing bodies. They don't want children in early elementary grades to read books or use gender-coloring books encouraging them to disassociate their minds from their bodies, and to focus on sex and sexuality at such a young age. 'Young children don't need to be shown a Blue's Clues Pride Parade video celebrating transgenderism and pansexuality, or Queer Kid Stuff videos that train them to ask people for their pronouns, or be told that doctors are sometimes wrong when 'assigning gender.  Children should not be instructed that there is no such thing as girls and boys. Lest this sound like an unlikely scenario: a lawsuit is being filed by a Canadian mother whose six-year-old daughter was taught 'girls are not real, and boys are not real' at school. It's more than understandable that parents have asked legislators to curb such gender-ideology activism in schools. ",
            "No one wants a child to feel 'not valued' or conform to one point of view. The problem is that progressives think their point of view is the only one and everyone else agrees. Otherwise opponents are labeled as homophobic or anti-LGBTQ. What Republicans are pushing for, though, is allowing young children to just be children. 'The teacher can monitor a student-led discussion on LGBTQ issues, should a child bring it up in class, but it will not be allowed to be a routine part of a class's curriculum. A young child may bring up that he or she has two moms, for example, and that can start a conversation in a classroom. It's important that it is an age appropriate discussion. The bill is a simple acknowledgement that very young children should not have to learn about mature topics in early elementary school years."

Whatever the secretary's personal views, and no matter how impossible her job, she was the face of some of the administration's most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies. At best, she was complicit and, yes, rather weak. 'Editorial Board, New York Times",
            "Nielsen carried out 'Trump's ghastly family separation policy at the southern border. and designed a plan that strictly limited the number of asylum-seekers allowed to enter the United States. And she implemented what was ultimately ruled to be an unlawful policy to prevent immigrants from applying for asylum if they entered the country illegally. But Nielsen drew the line at Trump's 'clearly illegal' demands, including 'blocking all migrants from seeking asylum.  She also reportedly refused to resume family separations, despite Trump's entreaties, because she did not want to violate a court order. 'If Nielsen and other DHS officials who were recently fired were not sufficiently extreme, it is alarming to consider what might come after them. Both bent the law as far as they could to implement hugely controversial and frequently vicious policies to further Trump's nativist goals. It wasn't enough for the president. With their ousters, DHS is entering a new era, one in which the agency will do whatever Donald Trump and Stephen Miller think it can get away with.",

S. aid to Central America---immediately putting him at odds with the president, who has ordered a cutoff of assistance to those countries. And McAleenan refers to the migrants arriving at the border not as scammers looking to cheat their way into the country but as 'vulnerable families' who need more humanitarian treatment. He has urged a fast and responsible screening process that will let true asylum seekers start their new lives in the United States once a court rules on their claims. Whether that is what the president and Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, are looking for on a long-term basis is not clear.",
            "Others note that 'the DHS is a sprawling giant of 22 agencies that merged together in the wake of 9/11. The department's 240, 000 employees handle everything from hurricanes to cyber security to border security to terrorism. As secretary of homeland security, a lot of things can happen on your watch: A botched response to a hurricane, or a serious cyber attack, or a major terrorist assault, or rising numbers of migrant families trying to cross the southern border. 'Almost a century ago one such desperate migrant, Mary Anne MacLeod, left the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Europe, to find work as a servant in New York. Mary later married Fred Trump. They had five children, including a son named Donald. Trying to dissuade migrants such as Mary Anne MacLeod from leaving countries where they see no future to seek their fortune in the United States is likely beyond the ken of any secretary of homeland security.",
            "US immigration law is a balance between the desire to minimize unauthorized entry into the United States and the desire to protect vulnerable people who may be fleeing harm and persecution. Both US and international law prohibit the US from refusing entry to people who are in danger of persecution in their home countries; both US statute and court settlements offer extra due-process protections to asylum seekers, children, and families. Trump's anger at Nielsen is really anger at this delicate balance. if Trump wants a DHS secretary who will stop people from setting foot on US soil, none of the options will satisfy him."

            "Grenell would be an odd choice if Trump wished to downplay Russian threats. To start, he is a longtime Russia hawk. Last year, for example, he warned German companies building the NordStream II pipeline between Germany and Russia that they would risk U. S. sanctions if they went forward with the project. More important, Grenell himself has said he will only be acting director, and that he expects the president will soon nominate someone else for the position. Intelligence assessments involve the input of 16 agencies and often take months to complete, so it would be near impossible for someone serving as acting director for a short period of time to suppress or alter intelligence products. 'So appointing Grenell may be less an effort to censor intelligence than a bit of hostage politics with the Senate. If the Senate doesn't confirm Trump's nominee, Grenell can serve for months. The two leading candidates for the job are Representative Chris Stewart, a Republican from Utah who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, and Pete Hoekstra, the current ambassador to the Netherlands and former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Both would likely face opposition from Democrats. The White House is hoping to force Democrats to hold their noses and not delay the confirmation.",
            "Grenell is highly unlikely to try and turn the intelligence community into a partisan war horse. Such an effort would fail in face of the institutional impulses those agencies have for the national interest and their mission. Moreover, for all his Twitter comments, Grenell is a patriot. From his seven-year tenure as chief spokesman at the United Nations and his time in Berlin (which has a large CIA station he would have liaised with), Grenell will know that good intelligence is forward-leaning, corroborated, and commensurate with policy-maker needs. 'In Grenell, Trump now has a smart, loyal voice to guide him on matters of national security. But the intelligence community also gets something: a leader with Trump's ear, and someone who is keen to impress. Both sides, then, can forge common ground in America's interest.",
            "The DNI doesn't have budgetary, personnel, or command authority over the community he overlooks; his job is to assess the intelligence that the IC creates, ask tough questions in an attempt to expose weakness or uncertainty, and present the views of the IC to the president in a useful form. In other words, the DNI is an evaluator, not an operator. Like top political leaders, he consumes rather than produces intelligence. 'There have been five Senate-confirmed DNIs since the job was created. Only two of them (Admiral Mike McConnell and James Clapper) came from the IC. The first DNI---John Negroponte---was a career diplomat and ambassador who went on to be deputy secretary of state. Another, Admiral Dennis Blair, came out of the Surface Navy and was a former commander of the United States Pacific Command. The latest DNI was Dan Coates, a well-respected Senator who had been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The point is that DNIs come from a number of different backgrounds. Grenell has years of international experience at both the U. N. and as ambassador to Germany, as well as in private life. In those capacities, he has had ample opportunity to see the strengths and weaknesses of the IC.",
            "The attempt to portray the ambassador as some kind of toady betrays the fact the critics' real fear is the president being served by those truly devoted to his agendathat is, that he be afforded the same privileges as every other president. Grenell will no doubt have his work cut out for him in overseeing some who will seek to undercut him to protect their turf from an executive they believe has infringed upon it. But Grenell's experience both in navigating a hostile UN, and grappling with the seminal national security and foreign policy issues of our time in the face of a recalcitrant German government, will no doubt serve him well.",
            "Regarding the intelligence briefing, 'The Republicans' objection was not to the idea that Russia is trying to interfere in a U. S. election. That is an accepted fact. The problem was the assessment that Russia is specifically trying to help reelect Trump. That claim, so incendiary in the 2016 election, was unsupported by the evidence, they said. intelligence officials did not have the evidence to make that assertion, and, almost as soon as the story broke, officials with knowledge of the meeting suggested that the headlines were wrong. On Sunday, CNN reported the officials had apparently 'overstated' the Putin-wants-Trump story. 'And then there were the circumstances of the briefing. The Intelligence Community works for the president. Yet, officials chose to brief Schiff's House Intelligence Committee on this extraordinarily consequential finding before telling the president. Later, just to make matters more difficult, there were leaks that Russia is also trying to help elect Bernie Sanders. The leak left many experts baffled, except to the extent that, with the Trump leak, it seemed to target the Intelligence Community's two least-favorite candidates."

            "Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, won the governor's mansion in 2018 in a tight election. Donald Trump carried the state handily in 2016 and 2020. Election officials reported results efficiently, enabling networks to call these races on election night. Mr. DeSantis himself declared that the state sets 'the gold standard' in election administration. 'He nevertheless wants state lawmakers to pony up $6 million to hire 52 people for his election police squad---which, naturally, would be under the governor's control and would investigate allegations of election crimes submitted by 'government officials or any other person. 'This would chill legitimate election work. In this, Mr. DeSantis's proposal would be similar to an anti-voting law Texas lawmakers passed recently, which would threaten election workers with criminal penalties for transgressions as mild as proactively offering voters mail-in ballot applications. In both cases, the effect is to intimidate people into thinking twice about doing anything they fear state authorities might construe as illegal. The system as it stands has kept fraud vanishingly rare in the United States. Proposals such as Mr. DeSantis's would only work to poison America's democracy.",
            "The authoritarian impulse has been a hallmark of DeSantis's tenure since the beginning. Last April, he signed an 'anti-rioting' law that was one of the most sweeping attacks on the right to protest in memory. Among other things, it offers civil liability protection to those who mow down protesters with their cars, and would allow peaceful protesters to be charged with a felony if other people at a protest they attended committed an act of violence. 'Last week Raul Pino, the director of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County, was 'placed on administrative leave, and the Florida Department of Health is conducting an inquiry to determine if any laws were broken in this case.  Because he encouraged public health workers to be vaccinated. Pino didn't impose a mandate on anyone. His email was asking, pleading, begging people to get vaccinated---not requiring them to do so. 'DeSantis has called Florida 'the freest state in these United States'. Unless, that is, the freedom you're interested in involves encouraging people to get vaccinated, protecting your employees and customers from a pandemic, teaching history honestly, voting, protesting or anything else Republicans might not want you to do.",
            "We're 10 months away from the midterm elections. Desperate for a contestany contestmost media outlets find DeSantis's growing profile delectable. 'And yet the nature of the feud itself says a great deal about how much the politics of Covid-19 have shifted in the year since Trump left office. Trump has, over the past year, beenat least by the dismal standards of the righta hype man for vaccines. DeSantis, meanwhile, has recently embraced vaccine skepticism and refused to disclose his own status. The result is. a rare instance in which Trump is 'out-of-step with the hardline elements of his party's base.  It also points to the growing potency of vaccine hesitancy on the right, as well as a potential fault line in upcoming elections in 2022 and 2024."

            "House Democrats throughout her tenure have played to maximize the success of the team: When out of power, they relax their ideological litmus tests in order to elect moderate-sounding people in swing districts, and when in power, they get those people to vote for progressive policy priorities knowing full well that this is not what their constituents want. But it's what Nancy Pelosi wanted. That's political hardball. It's why Pelosi became speaker twice, why she got things done for two Democratic presidents in the role, and why she has twice now found herself losing the majority.",
            "As liberal as Pelosi's record was. she also had a pragmatic streak and attempted to walk the more radical elements of her party back from the ledge. During the Bush era, she fought back efforts by progressives to 'defund' the Iraq War, fearing that it would backfire by making Democrats come off as anti-troop. During the Obamacare fight, she helped persuade progressives to vote for a final version of the bill that did not include a public option.",
            "Nancy Pelosi is a liberal who advanced liberal policies, but relatively speaking, she was also more pragmatic than the younger, more extreme elements within the party. Though we don't mourn her stepping down, without her at the helm, Democrats may have even fewer guardrails to prevent the party's continued leftward drift.",
            "Traditionally, defeated Speakers usually leave Congress, but Pelosi herself had already been an exception to that rule. She lost the gavel in the 2010 midterms, and failed to regain it in three subsequent national elections, including the one in which Barack Obama narrowly won re-election to the presidency. She regained it in the 2018 midterms, but then managed to be the first Speaker in long memory to lose seats while her party elected a new president. As Speaker, Pelosi will go out with a won-loss record in elections of 4-6.",

However, Pelosi raises tons of money for other House Democrats, and if she assumes that role, she likely will continue to control campaign cash, or at least influence its direction. A diplomatic post in Rome might be a great lark, but it will end Pelosi's ability to control outcomes in the House."

He projected confidence and competence on the coronavirus pandemic, arguably beating Bernie on points when it came to Medicare-for-all's relevance to the crisis. He got in some solid hits on Sanders's record, particularly on guns and immigration, and offered up one of the night's most memorable lines about the primary during an exchange on campaign finance: 'I didn't have any money and I still won'. This should quiet at least some of worrying about whether he can withstand the rigors of a campaign and the presidency.",

Sanders has never produced a detailed financing plan or theory of exactly how his vision for single-payer should work. His team thinks organizing is prior to wonkery, and the point is to lay down a principle.

He never actually says his proposal represents some kind of moral ideal. Indeed, it's not at all clear what Biden thinks an ideal health care system would look like. It's simply not the kind of question that interests him. Biden is doing politics. Bernie has been a politician a long time (and quietly knows how to do it pretty well) but fundamentally has the persona of a prophet. Democrats' choice is clearer than ever: Fight Trump or fight for revolution.",
            "Biden tried to extend olive branches to Sanders and his supporters Sunday night -- though his rival wasn't ready to bridge their ideological divides. The former vice president pointed to his moves within the previous two days to embrace free public university tuition for those whose families make less than $125, 000 per year and to embrace Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to undo much of a bankruptcy bill they'd fought over 15 years earlier. 'I agree with Bernie,  Biden said as they discussed surging help to hospitals facing the coronavirus pandemic. 'I agreed with Bernie,  he said later when noting they both believed those on Wall Street responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should have gone to jail.",
            "A word of advice to Joe Biden after Sunday night's debate: Call AOC. The politician who has shown the most lucid understanding of the importance of Democratic unity in the face of Donald Trump is Sanders' most obvious successor: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has urged the Democratic establishment to begin a conversation with younger Democrats. Rather than dwell on Sanders' likely defeat, she has already set her sights on obtaining concessions from Biden. 'Only 5 percent of young Latinos voted for Biden in California. The national picture is just as worrisome. As a proficient Spanish speaker who relates directly to the issues that have made progressive politics so relevant within the Latino community, Ocasio-Cortez could quickly upend that narrative. Granted, there isn't much competition, but no Hispanic politician can match her charisma. if she manages to navigate the tightrope between the Democratic party's progressive and moderate wings, Ocasio-Cortez could become Joe Biden's most important ally, a future presidential contender in her own right and Bernie Sanders' rightful heir as the voice of the progressive movement."

It's a preferable strategy for the Kremlin in three specific ways. First, it allows for a personal riposte to Biden's attack on Putin's character. 'Second, it plays to concerns in other governments that Biden is, perhaps, not as sharp as he once was. That is relevant in terms of the trust and confidence foundation, which ultimately underpins the U. S. -led liberal international order.

Yes, sure, fine, you can find nutty conspiracy theories, personal attacks, and unhinged demonization of Fauci, just as you can find that phenomenon of just about any public figure who has been venerated to the point of prayer candle merchandising. But has it ever crossed the minds of the team at Politico that maybe, just maybe, Fauci has earned some fair criticism? . 'Is it even remotely conceivable that significant swaths of the public are starting to get the sense that Fauci has been shading the truth and tweaking and tailoring his advice, sometimes in the face of well-reasoned opposition, for a long while now? Nothing Fauci's done earned him some criticism? Not even his reversal on masks? Nothing in his emails, suggesting a symbiotic relationship with adoring reporters? Nothing in his evasive answers about whether U. S. taxpayer money ended up financing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology? Nothing in Fauci's past defenses of gain-of-function research?",
            "Anthony Fauci's email correspondence from the early days of the pandemic have ignited a spate of recriminations over masks and the doctor's celebrity. But what really matters is that some of the emails raise more questions about the origin of Covid-19. 'From 2014-19, the National Institutes of Health sent $3. 4 million to the WIV Wuhan Institute of Virology through the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance. The NIH money was spent on researching bat coronaviruses, and it's likely the WIV conducted gain-of-function research to make them more deadly or infectious. 'Dr. Fauci has said his outfit didn't fund gain-of-function research; the EcoHealth Alliance funding was meant to go to collecting samples. But 'I can't guarantee everything that's going on in the Wuhan lab, we can't do that,  Dr. Fauci said Wednesday in an interview with NewsNation Now. Dr. Fauci also said this week that his emails 'are really ripe to be taken out of context' and that 'you don't really have the full context.  That may be true. But it's all the more reason to investigate the U. S. links to WIV and gain-of-function research. The issue relates to Covid's origins but also to the future risks and benefits of such research.",
            "Most of Fauci's biggest whoppers didn't need to be exposed in his email correspondence. In fact, he openly admitted to lying to the American people on multiple occasions. He told the New York Times that he moved the goal posts on herd immunity because of 'his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks'. It wasn't the only noble lie. 'When Sen. Rand Paul suggested the fully-vaccinated Fauci was only wearing a mask as a matter of theater, the doctor vehemently denied the claim. But a few weeks later Fauci told Good Morning America that he had kept wearing a mask because he 'didn't want to look like I was giving mixed signals'. It was all an act, none of it based on science---all of it based on optics.",
            "Fauci deceived the public about whether masks were necessary early on to preserve the existing supply for hospitals and he deceived the public again later by deliberately lowballing the threshold of herd immunity we'd need to contain the virus. That wasn't 'science.  That was government disinformation from a bureaucrat who hoped to engineer a particular policy outcome. 'It's true that in some cases his views have changed as data on COVID has developed. For instance, Fauci supported reopening schools many months ago as it became clearer that children didn't do much to spread the virus. Some of his 'reversals' are good-faith changes of heart in response to new studies. But not all are, and enough attention has been paid to those cases by now that you'd think he'd be more modest in trumpeting the alleged innocence of his approach."

That Barbie's Ken thinks men run the world by telling everyone what to do is correct---it is precisely what a little girl would imagine employment must be like after observing her mom coming home and routinely grousing about her jerk boss Kent.

            "There's no question that organized criminal elements, including drug-trafficking organizations and Colombian guerrilla groups, have penetrated state institutions in Venezuela. The allegations are not surprising given the clear corruption and authoritarianism of the Maduro regime, and they are serious. But the Trump administration's rhetoric clearly isn't. Venezuela is not a major transit country for drugs bound for the United States. 'According to the U. S. interagency Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB), 210 metric tons of cocaine passed through Venezuela in 2018. By comparison, in the same year about 10 times as much cocaine (2, 370 metric tons) passed through Colombia, and seven times as much cocaine (1, 400 metric tons) passed through Guatemala. So why is the Trump administration now raising the alarm about Venezuela 'flooding' the United States with cocaine, especially when the White House allowed anti-corruption efforts to die in more significant transit countries such as Honduras and Guatemala?",
            "If there were anything that could force the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro and his opposition to work together, it might have been the coronavirus. With the pandemic closing in on a country woefully ill-prepared to confront it, the president's opponents had begun to test the waters of negotiating with him, with the hope that cooperation on a plan to fight the virus might lead to wider political agreement or eventually even new elections. But this past week, the United States torpedoed that possibility. 'President Trump has from early in his administration been eager to undermine Maduro as a way to win votes in southern Florida, where many refugees from Venezuela and its close ally Cuba tend to vote for conservative Republicans. He has been frustrated his team has not made more progress in ousting the socialist leader. 'It's difficult not to see an explicit political motive here in the indictments: maximize all possible pressure on the regime when they are hanging by a thread,  said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan think tank in Washington.",
            "Mr. Maduro is already using Mr. Trump's move to bolster his support domestically and internationally. Countries including Mexico and Argentina, which are sympathetic to the Venezuelan regime, may call the charges exaggerated and cite international law to defy Washington. Mr. Maduro will keep denying the accusations, and claim the action against him is typical American interventionist meddling and extraterritorial application of its domestic legislation. 'Manuel Noriega was a U. S. toady before the George H. W. Bush's administration turned on him. Saddam Hussein bore the brunt of two American invasions before his execution. It does not seem likely that Mr. Trump would be willing to pay such a steep price for Mr. Maduro's demise. The Cubans, who play a crucial role in supporting the Maduro regime, have some experience in dealing with American hostility, warranted or not. The Castro brothers have outlasted 12 American presidents; Hugo Chavez and Mr. Maduro have outlasted four, if we include most of Mr. Trump's first term. The new measure, however valid on its merits, is not likely to alter the scoreboard.",
            "Meanwhile, 'The administration has shown little interest in measures to help Iran and Venezuela address the pandemic. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is right that Iran and Venezuela have squandered tens of billions of dollars on corruption, repression, and other malign activities that could have been used to fight the pandemic. But the reality right now is that sanctions should not compound human suffering by denying Iran and Venezuela the chance to purchase needed medical supplies, especially since dedicated humanitarian payment mechanisms can ensure that the funds are used only for that specific purpose.",
            "On paper, the unilateral U. S. sanctions say that medical supplies are exempt. But this is an illusion. Neither Venezuela nor Iran can easily buy medical supplies, nor can they easily transport it into their countries, nor can they use them in their largely public sector health systems. If any firm trades with Venezuela's public sector, it could face secondary sanctions. When the U. S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked about the half-million Iraqi children who died because of U. S. sanctions, she said that those deaths were a price worth paying. They were certainly not a price that the Iraqis wanted to pay, nor now the Iranians or the Venezuelans, or indeed the majority of humankind."

Some people might think this action makes America the 'world's policeman' and might be concerned by it as a result. But it doesn't. As Barr noted, these people broke American laws and attempted to import hundreds of metric tons of cocaine to the United States, an amount large enough to kill millions of people. It's not policing the world to enforce U. S. law. 'Maduro should take note that the last time a foreign dictator was charged in the U. S. was in 1988, when Manuel Noriega of Panama was charged with very similar crimes. Noriega was captured in less than two years and ended up in an American prison.",
            "While the Obama administration did next to nothing, Hugo Chavez consolidated a dictatorship and aided narcoterrorists to torment the US ally Colombia. Drug traffickers partnered with kingpins in Caracas have decimated democratic institutions and strangled honest commerce in Central America. 'Venezuela has become a regional hub of transnational organized crime---a lawless global network with $2. 2 trillion in annual revenue. Narcotraffickers from Mexico and Colombia; henchmen from Cuba, Russia, China, and Iran; and terror groups from Colombia and the Middle East all derive money and power from Venezuela. It is time to unsheathe indictments and unleash tough security measures to bring criminals to justice.",
            "These indictments are designed to put more pressure on Venezuelan military figures to abandon Maduro and put the legitimate interim president, Juan Guaido, in power. Maduro has been steadily escalating against Guaido this year, so increased questions were being asked as to how resolute the Trump administration was in its support for the interim president. These indictments confidently answer those questions. it is also important that the indictments do not focus on active uniform military officers who are heavily involved in the drug trade. The intended U. S. implication in turning a blind eye to these officers is that generals who now abandon Maduro can hope to avoid future U. S. criminal sanctions. 'But these indictments alone will not remove Maduro from power. More U. S. action will be needed if the generals are to decide to move against the pretender president. That means the U. S. should take decisive action, as requested by Guaido, to prevent Maduro's oil supplies from reaching Cuba. If Cuba is forced to abandon Maduro, his ability to intimidate and consolidate the military into his continued support will collapse. Still, these indictments are, in and of themselves, good news. They clarify America's position on Venezuela in a way that best serves our national interests and theirs.",
            "The dual problem of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in oil prices have managed to create in two short weeks what a concerted American sanctions campaign could not achieve, which is a potential knockout blow to the Venezuelan legal economy. The illicit economy in illegal gold and drug trafficking, of course, will continue to grow at an alarming rate. The United States needs to stay vigilant against the regime and trust the external conditions improve its odds of success. Under these conditions, if the American government fails to achieve its goals of deposing Maduro and imposing democratic elections in Venezuela, then it might never achieve them in the end.",
            "Some, however, argue that 'With the coronavirus epidemic now beginning to impact an under-resourced and unprepared Venezuelan hospital system, regime change in Caracas would serve no purpose other than introducing a greater degree of anarchy inside the country. That, in turn, would result in more refugee flows, more humanitarian disaster within Venezuela's borders, and more destabilization in the region at large. 'The best way Washington can contribute is by getting out of the way, allowing its Latin American partners to take the lead in facilitating a diplomatic formula acceptable to both sides, and providing humanitarian aid to neighboring countries (like Colombia) that are in the unenviable position of managing the migration flows. Filing criminal charges against Nicolas Maduro may be emotionally satisfying for the investigators and prosecutors who have been working on this case. But in terms of foreign policy, this action seeks to replace one problem with another, a mistake that will have unintended humanitarian, political, and diplomatic repercussions."

            "Adam Toledo's situation, perhaps like any such situation, is complex. The police officer had reason to believe that someone at the scene was armed. But it's also hard not to wonder why the situation couldn't have been defused without Adam being shot. This was a child, a 13-year-old. A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon? . 'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, 'despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. 'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.",
            "The post-Floyd reckoning in the media has emphasized the need for journalists to look skeptically at claims from police and other officials following a killing, as they may come undone when more facts come to light. 'Shortly after the March 29 death of Toledo, a Cook County prosecutor claimed that Toledo was shot while holding a gun in his right hand. But body camera footage released on Thursday suggests this claim was inaccurate, as it appears to show the boy unarmed and with his hands raised when he was shot. Officials also described the incident as an 'armed confrontation,  without noting that Toledo had complied with officer instructions to drop the firearm and put his hands up.",
            "Justice for Adam Toledo requires investments in our Black and brown communities and disinvestments in policing. One would be a proposal by the Chicago-based, Black youth-led GoodKids MadCity collective called the Peace Book, which would create neighborhood peace commissions with resources sufficient to meet community needs. The resources include funds for positive youth spaces, political and art education, mental health treatment, restorative justice, and conflict resolution services. The Peace Book could operate with a diversion of just 2 percent, or $35 million, from the CPD's budget. 'Second, the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance, sponsored by Chicago Democratic Socialist Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and backed by a diverse, citywide coalition, would prohibit CPD officers from responding to people in mental health crises and instead fund community-based mental health professionals. Similar programs in Oregon both reduce police violence and better serve community needs.",
            "At a young age, Adam was categorized as a special education student and separated from everyone else at school. Surrounded by the same six students with varying degrees of severe learning disabilities, Adam didn't have the chance to develop strong friendships with any of his classmates. 'According to one teacher 'It was clear he needed someone to talk to and the space to socialize himself better. He really liked to draw, his penmanship was perfect. I think if we offered an art class, he would've taken it, but we don't even offer that to our students. He just needed one friend, one classmate or one other student he could connect with'. 'Defunding the police' means providing us with adequate funding for after-school programming, violence prevention initiatives, creative arts curricula and workforce development opportunities. Chicago, known across the world as 'Chiraq,  has fostered street gang culture for more than a half century. I was 15 years old the first time a gang member gave me a pistol. As children, we normalize gun violence to the degree of no longer flinching at the sound of gunshots. Adam Toledo did not deserve to be killed by Chicago police. He, like many children from our side of the city, deserves more."

It's not that they expect any particular faux-scandal to stick, but they hope that raising one after another will create a generalized perception that the court is corrupt, and its decisions---say, overturning affirmative action, or upholding gun rights---will thus be delegitimized, making it easier for Democratic officials to disobey them.",
            "At the same time, the 'ethics' attacks on the court serve as a smokescreen to conceal the much bigger ethical problems that go unaddressed. ProPublica, for example, crusades against fully publicized matters like Alito's trip, even as it rakes in millions of dollars from undisclosed donors.

That is how real investigations and hearings work: They are adversarial proceedings. Alas, Pelosi chose not to play ball with McCarthy, turning the committee into an exercise in partisan theater, instead.",

The fact that Republicans have cynical, self-serving reasons for not taking the Democrats seriously does not erase the fact that there are excellent reasons for not taking the Democrats seriously.",

And if these hearings go nowhere, which is likely, and if Democrats get pulverized in November, which also is likely, what are Democrats going to say?

In fact, the 2008 hospitality exclusion applied only to food, lodging and entertainment, with no mention of transportation.",

Studies have shown that physicians' prescribing practices can be influenced by such minor gifts as pens, notepads and sandwiches. One study of over 125, 000 physicians found that receipt of a single inexpensive meal was associated with increased prescriptions of the donor's brand-name medication. Supreme Court justices no doubt believe they are immune to such effects, but so do doctors.",
            "Can anyone say with a straight face that no 'unbiased and reasonable person' would question the justice's impartiality when he votes for someone who gave him a valuable gift? Isn't there at least the appearance that something other than the strict application of the rule of law is at work? And appearances count, perhaps nowhere more than at the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of many of the most fraught issues of American life.",
            "If the justices are confused as to the reason public trust in the court is in free fall, they need look no further than Justice Alito's smug, defensive reaction to a very fair criticism. As long as the court refuses to accept significantly stricter ethics rules, either adopted by themselves or imposed by Congress, that trust---and with it the court's legitimacy---will continue to erode until it's not worth a seat on a private jet.",

The most powerful body in the government happens to be the one that is allowed to follow the most lax ethics requirements."

            "Reports that President Donald Trump wants to send 5, 000 more troops to the Southern border, at first, come as a shock. It's a startlingly high number. To put it in perspective, NATO recently deployed 4, 500 troops in the Baltic nations to deter and repel a Russian tank assault. How many troops could possibly be needed to stave off an unarmed caravan of refugees walking up through Mexico? ",
            "According to former Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, this is 'a misuse of active duty military. To say this isn't a political stunt is misleading the public.",
            "The Trump administration has produced no evidence to support the president's repeated claims that criminals are in the caravan. Moreover Trump's claim that 'you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process' does not make sense. Many of the caravan members plan to request asylum, which requires that a person already be in the United States. ",
            "No doubt some of the caravan members will weigh the odds and decide they have a better chance of sneaking over illegally. But if even a few thousand were to try it, they would pose no unusual challenge to the Border Patrol---which apprehended nearly 6, 000 people every week last year crossing from Mexico. 'It's worth noting that while data specifically on refugees and those granted asylum are hard to come by. the New American Economy Research Fund looked at the 10 cities with the highest rates of refugee arrivals and found that 'nine out of 10 of the communities actually became considerably more safe, both in terms of their levels of violent and property crime'.",
            "Some posit that 'the United States has sabotaged itself. The migration crisis stems not from foreign nations duping the United States but rather from American economic development policies. that have exacerbated the poverty, despair and violence such policies were supposed to alleviate. ",
            "Others ask, 'What do we do when the caravan gets here? And more saliently: What do we do if many more caravans show up behind it? . This is not a passing crisis. It is the new normal, and its optics do nothing but intensify the cultural panic that is turning much of the West to authoritarianism as a response. Democrats can't keep dodging immigration as a real issue."

            "Mike Bloomberg Is hacking your attention. There are his ubiquitous television, YouTube and Facebook ads. There are his tweets, many of which are weird enough to generate the right amount of viral confusion or are pugnacious enough toward Donald Trump to provoke the ire of the presidential Twitter feed. Then there are the influencers. Starting this week the Bloomberg campaign enlisted the help of a number of popular meme-makers to create sponsored Instagram content for the candidate. 'On Twitter, where some Democratic hopefuls have adopted a 'they go low, we go high' mentality, Bloombergians have instead opted to wade into the mud and wrestle with Mr. Trump's Twitter feed. For citizens looking for a movement or big, structural change or even just a genuine vision for the future of the country, the strategy is disheartening---just another brazen attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator instincts of the internet that leaves a sinking feeling that shameless memes, Twitter dunks and toxic screaming into the algorithmic void have become politics as usual. Or maybe it's always been this way. After all, what is politics if not a long, well-funded attempt at hacking people's attention?",
            "What's interesting here is that, even if Bloomberg doesn't win the nomination---which he very likely will not---this digital ad spending could end up mattering, anyway. That's because Bloomberg has pledged to spend a large fortune to dislodge Trump even if he's not the Democratic nominee. 'That a democratic socialist could end up as the nominee, even as Democrats end up relying in part on billionaire Bloomberg's money to fend off what may be the largest disinformation warfare campaign in U. S. history---one partly enabled by the threat the Big Tech oligarchy poses to democracy---is another measure of just how weirdly unsettled our politics are right now. It also hints at the odd compromises that might be necessary to survive the current crisis.",
            "Throw them up against the wall. It is impossible for me to imagine that those words would have rolled off Bloomberg's tongue had he been speaking to a room full of young black and brown men. Or, if people who looked like members of his own family faced that kind of scrutiny as they moved about their communities. In order for people to unfold their arms, he is going to have to face the wall of justified anger and absorb it at full blast. He has to be willing to talk about race and racism, not once or twice but with consistency and courage. 'He has to be willing to address the mind-set that created stop-and-frisk and keeps some version of it alive. And that means bringing cops to the table and pushing the leadership and the rank-and-file in blue to interrogate the social and racial factors that lead to disproportionate levels of scrutiny aimed at black and brown men. That will not be easy. But it is worth the risk. A leader who can create a pathway toward a model of policing that seeks justice, while facing up to historical injustice, would be doing a great thing for all of America.",
            "'Ninety-five percent of murders, murderers and murder victims' are male minorities between 16 to 25, Bloomberg said in 2015. This is actually not true -- not in New York City, and not nationwide. Lots of Democrats made significant mistakes in the 1990s when it came to being tough on crime -- mistakes that were readily apparent by the mid-2000s. But You cannot be the leader of a diverse, justice-oriented party when you said, just a few years ago -- well after we well knew just how damaging over-policing and mass incarceration are -- that 'the way you get the guns out of the kid's hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them. ",
            "Some, however, argue that 'Bloomberg's mistakes. have to be weighed against a record of courageously speaking out and devoting enormous personal resources to virtually every progressive cause---gun control, abortion rights, climate change, Planned Parenthood, education reform for predominantly minority schools, affordable housing, income inequality and tax reform. And he has vowed as president to focus on building black wealth, not just ending poverty. Sitting here today, Bloomberg---paired with a progressive vice-presidential candidate who can appeal to Sanders's voters---has the best chance to carry the day."

If we're looking at $100 billion a year for as long as the war goes on, that could mean several hundred billion more dollars.

If Mitch McConnell believes, as he has said, that the most important priority for Republicans in the defense budget is to deliver aid to Ukraine, he should say which aspects of the defense budget he views as being of lower priority, or identify cuts elsewhere in the budget to pay for it. If Democrats believe that funding Ukraine aid is critical, they should decide whether doing so is more important than protecting entitlements or advancing other spending priorities.",

Not the massive crisis on America's southern border, which Washington has demonstrated no interest in solving. Not the drug abuse crisis (fentanyl) that is killing so many Americans.

            "On just about every item, the appropriation is inadequate to the level of need. Democrats should certainly push for better terms (extending the enhanced unemployment benefits beyond four months, or tying them to some objective measure of labor-market conditions such as the unemployment rate, seems like an especially worthwhile place to push). But it's not clear to me how Democrats end up with a much better deal than this. 'If they do not sweep the Georgia Senate election runoffs in January, then Mitch McConnell will still control the Senate when Biden takes office, while Nancy Pelosi will preside over a much slimmer House majority than she does now. I see little basis for believing that Democrats will be able to get better terms from this new Congress than they have from the current one. 'More important, America's most vulnerable cannot wait two months for aid. And from a macroeconomic perspective, an ounce of recession prevention is worth a pound of cure. If America enters a recessionary spiral---with job losses leading to lower consumer spending, leading to more job losses---the fiscal cost of helping every constituency that Democrats wish to aid will rise substantially.",
            "Probably the most controversial aspect of the proposal is its omission of another round of direct payments to households, though this is defensible given its inclusion of $26 billion in additional nutritional aid for low-income families. Imperfect as it is, the bipartisan proposal merits support both in substantive terms and political ones. 'Substantively, it is better---much better---than nothing, which is what the 10 million who remain jobless, and the 26 million facing food insecurity, are getting now. Politically, it shows the way to yes for the negotiators, Mr. Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ), and puts pressure on them to get there. Things might have been easier if Ms. Pelosi had shown more flexibility before the election; they'd be easier now if Mr. McConnell would budge from his maximum of $500 billion and if Mr. Trump would press for legislation instead of ranting about vote fraud. Cooler heads must prevail lest eight months of hard-won economic progress be allowed to unravel.",
            "Critics of the bill, however, posit that 'Unable to pass the federal liability shield legislation on its own, lawmakers from both parties have now come together in a grand show of post-election bipartisan unity to help their corporate donors create a hostage situation that's something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie. Their proposal predicates long overdue and desperately needed unemployment assistance on the condition that corporations are given a get-out-of-jail-free card. corporate managers were allegedly betting on the number of COVID deaths that would happen at a meatpacking plant. 'With liability shields, those same employers will know that they can get away with all kinds of cost-slashing and corner-cutting that endangers workers and denies them access to basic protective gear. In other words, corporations will know they can drive the COVID body count ever higher, and they won't even have to worry about being called into a courtroom to answer for their crimes. 'The shield would strip frontline workers of their last remaining legal tool to protect themselves in the workplace---at the same that time the unemployment system is designed to financially punish those workers if they refuse to return to unsafe workplaces during the pandemic.",
            "Coming in at just over $900 billion, the bipartisan proposal moved substantially away from what Democrats want (around $2 trillion) and a whole lot closer to what Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) has pushed for (around $500 billion). Naturally, the Senate majority leader responded to this dramatic move in his direction by immediately announcing that this compromise is a non-starter. 'By reaching this agreement with Republicans, a group of Democratic senators made it easier for McConnell to demand that they move still further in his direction once he tries to jam them with his proposal in the upcoming funding bill. Now the 'compromise' position has moved to a point between $900 billion and $500 billion. Which raises a question: Is there any serious utility at all in Democratic senators seeking compromise with Republicans, even ones who appear to be acting in good faith, if there's simply no chance that it will meaningfully influence McConnell, and if it's preordained that McConnell will simply seize on this to his tactical advantage?"

Something that inflammatory showing up a few weeks before the election couldn't simply be dumped out to the public without checking into it. But people did check and have since found two people copied on some of the emails who verified their authenticity. Then they reported on it with that supporting testimony to back it up. 'If the FBI had found anything tying the laptop to the Russians we'd probably have heard about it by now. I'll even concede that it's still possible that some bad actors, be they foreign or domestic, could theoretically have been involved in making the contents of Hunter Biden's hard drive available as some sort of oppo project. 'But at the end of the day, the only real question is whether or not the emails are real and if they were composed by Hunter Biden. Neither Hunter nor his father's campaign has once tried to deny the authenticity of the emails. And the previously mentioned confirmation offered by other recipients of the messages pretty much seals the deal.",
            "Even if the information had been hacked, that would not make it inauthentic. The reason hacking is a serious offense that causes humiliation and wreaks financial and privacy havoc is because it exposes true information. The hacked Democratic National Committee emails were a problem for Democrats in 2016 because they were real. Media outlets published stories about them, and the Obama administration confronted the Russian regime over them, because the emails were authentic. Hacking is a bad thing. but there's nothing about it that makes the stolen information suspect. 'The Biden campaign's initial reaction was to check the former vice president's official calendar---after which the campaign first lamely said there was no notation of any such meeting, and then meekly admitted that Biden might well have met with the Burisma executive. But notice what they didn't say: Nobody claimed there was no need to check any official calendar because the email was a fake. They assumed it was authentic, because there was no good reason not to. At the moment, the known evidence overwhelmingly tends to establish that the laptop is exactly what it is represented to be: the repository of Hunter Biden's authentic emails, documents, photos and videos.",
            "According to the emails, both Bidens were in line in 2017 to benefit from a deal with CEFC. One email. refers to financial payments in terms of '20' for 'H' and '10 held by H for the big guy?  Fox News says it has confirmed the veracity of the email with one of its recipients and that sources say the 'big guy' is Joe Biden. 'Mr. Biden was a private citizen in 2017 but was considering a presidential run. A transaction that would have made himor his sonpartners with an entity tied to the Chinese government raises questions about judgment and how he would handle China as President. Joe Biden ought to clear the air on this China business in his own political interest. 'President Trump, as usual, is muddying the story with inappropriate demands that the Department of Justice investigate a potential crime. But the real burden here should be on Mr. Biden and the press. Perhaps Joe Biden wasn't involved, and Hunter was using his father's name to advance his own business interests. But it's also possible that Joe Biden was aware of the CEFC business and was unwilling to tell his son that he couldn't trade on his father's name and position. Whatever the truth, the public deserves better than Mr. Biden's Trump-like dismissal of the CBS reporter who so far is the only one brave enough to ask about the emails.",
            "Does anyone remember the Trump-Russia investigation? There were news stories that characterized a handshake and a chat between a figure in the Trump circle and a Russian, such as Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as 'contacts with Russians' worthy of investigation. Robert Mueller's prosecutors investigated one such meet-and-greet moment at the 2016 Republican convention, taking testimony under oath from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Trump aide J. D. Gordon, and others. Prosecutors also questioned Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner about a handshake and chat with Kislyak. 'Now, when the Biden campaign allows that there might have been an 'informal' and 'cursory' encounter between Joe Biden and an executive from the corrupt Ukrainian company that was paying his son $50, 000 a month to do nearly nothing, much of the political world's reaction is not only to deny the story without investigating but to praise social media companies for banning it.",
            "Nothing may be illegal here; voters can decide what to make of it. But it ought to register with you how cravenly some in the mainstream media are trying to convince you something isn't true that they know is true. The New York Post revelations are unlike many things you've seen reported as 'news' lately: There is meticulous, transparent sourcing. 'The technician who ended up in possession of Hunter's laptop is described in detail and has now been identified by name by other news outlets and even outed himself. The named persons of Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon vouched for how the data came into the Post's hands. Compare this to the vague, anonymous sourcing of so many Russia collusion stories or the New York Times's mysteriously sourced 'tax-return data' (not tax returns) of Donald Trump."

            "Cops know that armed suspects most often discard their weapons on first perceiving the arrival of the police. The reason for this is simple: better to ditch the gun than get shot or catch a case for holding onto it (you can always get another one later). 'If an armed suspect doesn't abandon his gun, the pursuing officer has no choice but to assume the suspect intends to use it against him, and any reasonable officer will respond accordingly at the first indication of such intent. Sadly for Toledo, perhaps due to his youth and inexperience, he acted in such a way that his movements were interpreted as preparation to fire rather than discard the gun he carried. 'In Graham v. Connor (1989), the U. S. Supreme Court held that the 'reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  So, viewing the events from this perspective, we have Officer Stillman responding to reported gunshots at 2: 30 a. m. and confronting two males in the immediate vicinity. 'Both of those males refuse to comply with a uniformed police officer's clearly stated orders to stop, and one of them runs nearly the length of a football field before stopping, pulling a gun from his pocket or waistband, and turning toward Stillman. On seeing the gun, Stillman reasonably believed Toledo was preparing to shoot him and fired in self-defense, striking Toledo in the chest.",
            "Less than one second elapsed between Toledo beginning his turn toward the officer with a gun in his right hand and then dropping the gun, and the officer firing a single shot from his service weapon. And these were not ideal conditions in which to make a split-second decision: it was dark, and Stillman's heart rate and adrenaline levels were likely elevated due to the foot chase. 'Was it really so unreasonable for Stillman to have genuinely perceived a risk to his own life when he decided to pull the trigger? I don't think so, but I'm certain of one thing: that's not a question you can answer based on a single, out-of-context freeze-frame. Those who attempt to do so show their extreme ignorance of the realities of dynamic situations like these. 'Such hasty conclusions also reinforce cops' perception, which I suspect is becoming even more widespread, that they should not expect fair treatment if they have the misfortune of being involved in a use-of-force incident. As that perception deepens among cops, we run the risk of more and more officers prioritizing risk-minimization over being proactive. As the past year of escalating crime has shown us, that's a recipe for more tragedy. 'Rafael A. Mangual, City JournalSome argue that 'I hate to second-guess the officer, who was involved in a foot chase and undoubtedly surging with adrenaline, knowing that he was looking for an armed suspect. I hate to do it, but we have to because this sort of thing happens way too often. We also have to second-guess the entire police department because, if not for the body camera, the official record would reflect that Toledo was holding a gun when he was shot by Stillman. When government lawyers tell lies that are contradicted by body camera footage, is it any wonder that people mistrust the police? . 'I am not advocating for defunding the police, but we do need police reform. There are a few ideas that seem like good places to start. The first is to better screen police applicants and weed out people who are too aggressive and combative. Another important reform is better training. Too often, the reaction is to shoot first and ask questions later. Several veterans have made the point that American soldiers serving in combat zones have more strict rules of engagement than police officers patrolling American cities. This needs to change. 'I don't believe that Officer Stillman set out that night to kill a child. I also don't think that he shot Toledo. because he was a minority kid. But the fact remains that Stillman did kill an unarmed seventh-grader."

            "During oral arguments in the case, the five conservative Justices seemed to agree with the Trump Administration that Congress has delegated to the Commerce Secretary broad authority over Census questions. As Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas noted in a related opinion last fall, it's not unconstitutional for cabinet officers to have political motives for a policy. Political appointees also consult with outside experts like Hofeller all the time, as the Obama Administration often did on regulation and litigation. The real goal of flogging the Hofeller memo now is to raise enough of a political stink to intimidate the Supreme Court to block the citizenship question.",
            "The citizenship question was asked routinely until 1950, after which it was removed from the survey. In the midst of our current immigration crisis, there is certainly very good reason to know how many of the people in the country are citizens, and how many are essentially guests, whether invited or not. The nation ought to be able to have the facts at hand as we decide whether to close the southern border a la Trump or open it per Beto O'Rourke.",
            "Equalizing for citizen population, rather than total population, will have the effect of giving eligible voters equality of electoral power. Consider this: In states with large numbers of noncitizens such as Texas, New York, and California, some state legislative districts may have twice as many eligible voters as adjoining ones. This means districts with fewer citizens have more electoral power than the districts with more citizens. That isn't fair. 'Equalizing districts by the number of citizens prevents some voters from having their votes over-weighted and over-valued, while others are under-weighted and under-valued. If one-person, one-vote---one of our most enduring egalitarian principles---has any meaning, the citizen population gaps in voting districts must not be so glaringly wide. Without census data that includes citizenship status, it is probably not possible for states and smaller jurisdictions to draw election districts that equalize eligible voters.",
            "It is worth noting that the citizenship question does not ask about a person's legal status; it merely asks about citizenship status and thus has nothing whatsoever to do with immigration enforcement. In fact, federal law prevents census data from being used for anything other than statistical analysis. That is the law and there is no evidence any agency intends to violate it. If there is a legitimate fear at all, it is that media hype may create a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is reckless and irresponsible of elected leaders in our country to give minorities the mistaken impression that they have anything to fear from the census for the sake of political gain.",
            "What is odd about the challenge by blue states and liberal advocacy organizations is that even the United Nations. sides with the Trump administration on this issue. In its 2017 'Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses,  the U. N. recommends that member countries ask census questions identifying both an individual's country of birth and country of citizenship. A Commerce Department memorandum on this subject dated March 26, 2018, notes that countries asking a citizenship question on their census include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom."

            "Though a variety of factors contribute to business decisions like these, it's worth remembering that General Motors warned in June that Donald Trump's tariffs would adversely affect the company, leading to, among other things, 'less investment' and 'fewer jobs.' ",
            "Until now, it appeared President Donald Trump had done a good job of energizing the American economy, specifically when it came to jobs. Legitimately or not, he has been praised for record low unemployment -- now at 3. 7%. That Trump's economic policies are in any way causing manufacturing plants to close and jobs to be eliminated could be a stake in the heart of the Trump presidential experiment. ",
            "While 'it is largely true that Trump himself is not directly responsible for the layoffs, which will impact 14, 000 workers in Ohio, Michigan, Maryland and Canada, and reflect complicated decisions that appear rooted in lagging sales. the problem for Trump is that Trump has constantly asserted that such industrial job losses won't occur on his watch. ",
            "But 'even a competent president would not be able to replace all the factory jobs that were lost, because most of them didn't actually move overseas, as is the common refrain. Rather, they were automated. That's why U. S. factories are producing twice as much as they did in 1984, but have shed over 5 million jobs since 1987. That's also why Trump's solution, to impose heavy tariffs on our trading partners, has not worked and has, in fact, killed more jobs by making everything more expensive. ",
            "What GM and every competitive American company does is follow the customers. last quarter General Motors sold more vehicles in China than in the United States. Making cars in America for export to China would render them 'structurally unprofitable'. It would be helpful if Trump recognized that being president doesn't make him economy czar; he can't force companies to continue to operate factories that aren't profitable. ",
            "As 14, 000 people and their families fretted looming unemployment, with Christmas just weeks away, investors celebrated. GM stock closed up 5 percent on Monday. This points to the growing disconnect between what's good for Wall Street and what's good for Main Street. Monday underscored that, perhaps now more than ever, what's good for GM is not necessarily what's good for America."

Of course, a lot can change between now and November of next year. And in fairness to Trump, it is true that state-level polls underestimated his support in 2016. It's undeniable, however, that the 2020 polling, taken in its totality, doesn't look good for Trump right now.",
            "The head-to-head polling doesn't really tell us much about events 18 months in the future, but it does tell us there's no counterintuitive process whereby Trump secures the votes of tons of people who say he's doing a bad job as president. The public is mostly saying they want to vote for any Democrat, and the strongest pattern so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than the more obscure ones. Rather than being either complacent or paralyzed by fear, Democrats should probably take a modest amount of reassurance from Trump's bad polls and try worrying about everything else for a minute.",
            "Many argue that, 'Biden is wrong to imply that if only Trump is gone, Republicans in Congress will immediately negotiate with a Democratic president in good faith. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) brags that he will continue to be the 'grim reaper' and destroy any legislation from a Democratic president, while promising to further pack the Supreme Court if a vacancy arises during an election year. Biden and Democratic candidates for the presidency, House and Senate should run against the hugely unpopular 'grim reaper' McConnell and the Trump Republicans in Washington.  Brent Budowsky, The Hill",
            "Does Biden believe in his own powers of persuasion? Or is he attempting to woo prized Obama-to-Trump voters, not to mention upscale white suburbanites reported to be appalled by Trump's behavior? . But there's another crowd this stuff appeals to as well, a group that would rather not discuss the economic issues that contributed to Trump's victory. That would be the donor class of the Democratic Party. 'There's lots of evidence to suggest that Biden really does think he brings unique skills at bipartisanship to the presidential table. He did make deals with the Republicans aplenty in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. But they were deals like the Hyde Amendment and bankruptcy 'reform' that made life harder for people in financial trouble or struggling with student debt, though not for the wealthiest. If members of the Democratic donor class are putting their faith in Biden, it's hard to blame them. The real question is whether voters will continue to support Biden as it becomes clearer and clearer that his promise of bipartisanship is simply another, more politically palatable way of saying that the rich will continue to come first.  Helaine Olen, Washington Post",
            "Regarding Buttigieg's speech, some argue, 'He is an heir to Obama's cautious and intellectual worldviewexcept that while Obama was, at heart, a realist influenced by the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr and the actions of Brent Scowcroft, Buttigieg is more motivated by values. Buttigieg is, at heart, a liberal internationalist who is looking beyond interventions to challenges posed by great powers, bridging the gap between the Obama and Clinton wings of his party. He fears that, left untended, threats to liberty abroad will ultimately threaten liberty at home. Buttigieg still has a lot of work to do to unpack what this means, but if he sticks to it and is bolder than he was on Tuesday, he may be able to articulate the alternative he promised.",
            "Others contend, 'Buttigieg wants to set a generous narrative of national identity against Trump's cramped and cruel vision, and against the progressive hostility to any national identity at all. It won't be easy. He speaks of the compassion of his Indiana neighbors toward refugees, their desire to be part of 'a greater project' than just America First. But the strongest political emotions of the moment are fear, disillusionment, and hatred. As impressive as he is personally, Buttigieg hasn't yet found the words, the music, and the policies to make his appeal convincing.  George Packer, The Atlantic"

One moment, they're casting him as a Stalinesque puppetmaster; the next he is a senile, powerless figurehead being manipulated by others behind the scenes. Fauci has, in recent days, arrived as a stand-in: a convenient means of savaging the Biden administration without having to attack Biden himself.",

'Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,  the study said, while adding that 'it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here. 'Fauci certainly cast doubt on the lab leak theory. But he generally couched it as there being no real evidence of it, rather the conclusive evidence to disprove it, and he was doing so at a time in which most other scientists were doing the same thing. There is quite simply no evidence that Fauci was delivered anything amounting to solid evidence of a lab leak.",
            "Though the lab leak theory has been embraced more on the political right, Rutgers University biologist Richard Ebright says it was Republican hawks under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney who pushed for the NIH to fund more of the sort of research that could have both health and bioweapons applications---or could be seen as defensive against biological attack. And it was academics on the left who warned this work could endanger our safety in the name of improving it. 'If Fauci owes the public an explanation for anything, it's why he approved funding for research that potentially made viruses more dangerous---so-called gain of function research. Though Fauci has been unofficially anointed America's 'top expert in infectious disease' by the press, his real job is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In that capacity, he's not above criticism. He's approved funding of projects on viruses that other scientists have deemed too risky to be worth doing. 'Faye Flam, BloombergRegarding Fauci's initial advice not to wear masks, 'In February and early March of 2020, anything Covid-19-related was unclear even to health professionals, and a leading line of discourse was that Americans should not wear masks because they weren't thought to be effective in screening out viral particles shed by others. While that information continues to be believed accurate. it was eventually found that encouraging everyone to wear masks helped to prevent the actively infected from spreading the shed viral particles as easily to others. 'There was also an effort to keep the panic-driven public from buying all available masks and putting health care workers at risk of running out of supplies. During a June 3 CNN interview addressing the emails, Fauci reiterated that if he had all the information he had today, his advice from early in the pandemic would be drastically different, and that masks do in fact work. But it doesn't look like Fauci's explanation will ease the backlash."

            "Gerwig's solo directing career thus far (which includes Lady Bird and Little Women) is a triumph of reimagination, an exploration of what it means to find out who you are and not allow yourself to be shaped by nostalgia and sentimentality while also living with deep, real love. That she managed to infuse the same sensibilities into Barbie is something near a miracle.",

Are audiences meant to cheer on the empowered girlboss exploits of the live-action embodiment of a now 64-year-old fashion doll? Or, on the contrary, should we be critiquing the male gazedriven industrial economy that made generations of little girls believe that the highest achievement of adult womanhood was an anatomically impossible waist-hip ratio? And what about those of us who grew up Barbie-indifferent? .",
            "Yes, yes, and yes, responds Barbie: This movie is for you. Can any one movie be all those things at once? Gerwig's answer to that conundrum is to serve up a multilayered concoction that's as busy as a fully accessorized Dreamhouse: an earnest feminist manifesto inside a barbed social satire inside an effervescent musical comedy, all designed in colors and textures so sumptuous they make 1950s Technicolor look desaturated. Barbie never completely resolves the paradox at its heart. But it is a delight of improbable proportions.",

Like a college freshman taking an intro class on gender---or perhaps like a high-schooler seeing a mass-market blockbuster with a developed political streak for the first time---Barbie becomes abruptly aware of the untenable societal pressures heaped upon womankind, released in a cathartic monologue by normal-person surrogate America Ferrera.",

Ms. Nielsen wasn't responsible for the surge of Central American migrants arriving at the border to claim political asylum, but Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress both needed a fall guy. Mr. Trump's immigration strategy is failing even on his own top priority of border security. He needs to get past his fixation with the border wall and make the case to the public and Congress for bipartisan immigration solutions.",

The obvious culprit in the present border overload is the Democrats' refusal to address the asylum law loopholes that prohibit border agents from turning illegal aliens around at the border once they utter the words: 'I want asylum.  Asking Nielsen to single-handedly reverse this insane policy would be asking her to break the law.",

Sometimes that means honorable figures must lose their jobs in order for a new team to come in, clean house and then move in a more decisive manner. Nielsen's successor deserves more support from Congress as well as the White House than she received, but it won't hurt to have someone in the job who is perceived as tougher by observers on both sides of the border. In a crisis like the one we're facing at the border, Trump should keep firing people until he finds the ones who will do the job.",

The department is home to the three immigration services. but it is also home to the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Protective Service, and more. 'In considering possible replacements for Nielsen, the president and his advisers should keep in mind that the Secretary of DHS is not a kind of minister of immigration.

            "A trove of documents brought to the attention of the Supreme Court on Thursday makes it hard to see the Trump administration's efforts to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census as anything but a partisan power grab. An accurate and fair count of everyone in America isn't just any policy goal. There's much at stake with the 2020 census---from the future of the next redistricting cycle to how billions of dollars in federal funding will be allocated. The Supreme Court should see this new evidence for what it seems to reveal: A blatant attempt to rig a constitutional mandate.",
            "The newly revealed documents show that the Trump administration's purpose in putting the citizenship question on the upcoming census was not its stated one to help Hispanic voters under the Voting Rights Act, but rather to create policy that would be 'a disadvantage to the Democrats' and 'advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.  It's difficult to produce a greater smoking gun than explicitly saying you are hoping to help the GOP by increasing white voting power. 'Even if it is otherwise constitutionally permissible to experiment with different understandings of how to draw districts with equal populations under the equal protection clause, the government should not be able to do so if the purpose is to dilute the power of political adversaries and minority voters, as demonstrated in this case by the new revelations.",
            "Long before Trump was even elected, Republican Party insiders were plotting to increase white political power at the expense of people of color. After Trump was elected, they implemented this plan by insisting that their actual goal was the protection of minority voting rights. there was the real reason and the stated reason, the truth and the pretext. 'That the Republican effort to increase white political power might be motivated by partisanship rather than racism is little solace. Segregationist Democrats might not have insisted on disenfranchising black voters after Reconstruction had those voters not been staunch Republicans. Whether motivated by partisanship or racism, though, the result is the same. Yet the census case does not hinge on whether the citizenship question is discriminatory. Rather, as a matter of administrative law, the executive branch must follow certain procedures before making decisions. The Trump administration's blatant dishonesty settles the question of whether it followed procedure definitively: It did not.",
            "Federal law protects the privacy of everyone who responds to the census. But that's small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercounted if there is a citizenship question on the census. 'By the bureau's own, nonpartisan analysis, adding a citizenship question to the 'short form' that will go to every household in America in 2020 could result in an undercount of 6. 5 million people---close to the entire population of Indiana or Tennessee. And the agency has told Mr. Ross that there are better alternatives to a citizenship question that wouldn't pose significant 'potential quality and cost disruptions' in administering the census, such as deriving citizenship data from the American Community Survey. At the heart of the dispute lies the question: Who gets to be counted?"

            "Heading into tonight, the majority of Democrats appeared set on nominating Joe Biden. Nothing that happened tonight changed the current trajectory. Quite a few of the debates this cycle felt like frustrating wastes of time, but this one felt particularly moot. The second hour was the non-coronavirus section, and the back-and-forth exchanges about climate change, fracking bans, immigration enforcement, and abortion access felt like a historical relic. Kids may not go back to school before autumn, and the economy is about to get pummeled, which makes the issue of the temperature in a hundred years seem particularly insignificant in the here and now.",
            "Bernie is, in practical terms, finished, and he plainly knows it. His clear goal in this debate, in the vein of issue and movement candidates since time immemorial, was to push his agenda on the party. Biden, though he came onstage wearing a red tie, took the bait. He bragged about his shifts to the left on abortion and immigration. He promised 'no new fracking,  committed to crackdowns on oil drilling, and pledged himself to the 'New Green Deal.  Some of those lines were delivered in gift-wrapped sound bites for the Trump campaign. All of which is why Biden, though he looked better than usual in this format, probably won't want to debate Bernie Sanders again.",
            "Biden's new position on immigration is that if he is elected, no one will be deported in his first 100 days as president. And he said a person who enters the U. S. illegally won't be deported even if the person has a criminal record in any foreign country, unless the immigrant is convicted of a felony in the U. S. That position on deportations is an extreme one that could cost Biden votes even in Hispanic communities among people who fear that new neighbors who have committed crimes elsewhere might commit crimes again in the U. S. 'Then Biden sought to appease the environmental community by pledging that there would be 'no new fracking' if he becomes president, and also said he would ban drilling for fossil fuels on public lands. Given the importance of fracking to the economies of key electoral states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Colorado, Biden is opening himself up to relentless attacks by Trump in the fall that he is anti-jobs and that he would make America dependent on imported oil and natural gas.",
            "Sanders argues that if we had socialized health insurance right now, nobody would have to pay for testing or treatment for the coronavirus. That's true, and if the only alternative were a total laissez-faire healthcare system, most of the population might side with Sanders. 'Sanders wants to expand the argument from people with the coronavirus shouldn't have to pay for treatment, to people with illness or injury shouldn't have to pay for treatment. But here's the thing: It's very sensible to have targeted government-guaranteed coverage for the coronavirus and not for broken bones. For one, the coronavirus looks like a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Second, it's incredibly contagious, and thus there are large externalities, and that's the problem here. In other words, there's a strong case for government action in this specific case---it's a lot simpler than a revolution.",
            "Some argue that 'Bernie Sanders gave his best debate performance of the 2020 presidential campaign. For the first time since these exchanges began last June, the Vermont senator got angry. He also got specific. On issue after issue, from immigration to health care to student debt to foreign policy, he challenged Joe Biden's record. The former vice president rolled his eyes, quibbled, and at times simply denied his own past votes. 'Sanders' best and last pitch was his most effective, one that he should have been making explicitly for the last nine months, namely, that Biden's campaign will not inspire the country. He will have the support of the Democratic establishment and many of the party's most reliable voters. He will also likely enjoy the support of some traditional Republican voters in wealthy suburbs across the United States. But that will not necessarily translate into the only thing that really matters: taking back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all three of which will likely be necessary for Democrats to win in November."

            "Regarding the Quinnipiac poll, 'I'm skeptical these numbers would actually be representative of the general election. According to the poll, Trump would barely edge out Biden among white voters, 47% to 46%. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 20 points among white voters---and this was not unheard of. Mitt Romney beat the Obama-Biden ticket by 20 points among whites in 2012, and John McCain won whites by 12 points in 2008. 'Quinnipiac also found that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , would get within eight points of Trump among white voters. Not since 1996, when Bill Clinton came within two points of Bob Dole, has any Democrat come within single digits among whites. It's just hard to see Harris having the best performance among whites in 24 years running against Trump, who has built his successful electoral career around white identity politics.",
            "We are 17 months away from the election. At this point in the 2016 election season, polls showed Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by huge margins. An Associated Press poll published on 10/25/16, two weeks before the election, gave the race to Clinton by 13 points, the same margin that Quinnipiac gives to Biden today.",
            "Iowa Democratic voters have seen and heard much more from the contenders than almost any other state, and thus are much less likely to base their preferences largely on name identification. For Biden, that hasn't been a good thing. The state's ideological lean also hampers Biden. Sixty-eight percent of 2016 Democratic caucusgoers were liberals, according to the entrance poll. That's bad news for Biden, whose national lead rests on moderate voters. There are simply many fewer potential Biden voters in the state than there are in the nation as a whole. This places organization at a premium, as it is crucial for him to turn out every last potential vote. If Biden can't win in Iowa, he's unlikely to be able to catch up later.",
            "Some argue, 'The only Democratic candidate with real national stature is former Vice President Joe Biden. But Biden has always been a weak, self-destructive candidate and he is still a weak, self-destructive candidate. From defending the Chinese, to sniffing people's hair, to plagiarizing others, there is a 'Bidenness' that plagued his first two campaigns for president and will probably destroy this one. If Biden does fade---and recent Iowa polls certainly make this possible---the Democrats will have no national candidate.",
            "Others contend, 'Biden's decision to change his position on the Hyde Amendment is actually something abortion supporters should welcome---because it is a tribute to the power they hold. Pro-lifers loved George H. W. Bush when he flip-flopped, and just look at the behavior of evangelicals in relation to Trump on social issues. Making converts out of politicians is what activism is all about. Punishing someone for joining you is politically insane, even for people who often seem politically insane. The truth is that Biden is running a nearly perfect campaign in the early going based on one implicit message: I can beat Trump, because I can speak to his voters and I'm not a crazy socialist like some of these other folks.",
            "Still others point out that 'a recent NPR/Marist poll finds only 18 percent support third-trimester abortion. Yet every Democratic senator running for president voted against a bill requiring doctors to help infants who survive a late-term abortion. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (N. Y. ) says there's no room in the party 'for a Democratic candidate who does not support women's full reproductive freedom.  That's slamming the door on a majority of voters. 'The Democratic contenders are espousing policies few Americans support and giving moderate and conservative members of their own party the cold shoulder. Democrats eyeing the White House need to get real. By writing off moderate and conservative members of their own party, they're boosting Trump's chances of reelection. Then again, Trump's reelection may be the gut punch that brings the Democratic party back to its senses."

            "When children come from non-traditional families, they need to be seen and recognized, not treated as so weird and deviant that their parents' relationship is unspeakable in school. When all the adults in a place are modeling exclusion and discrimination, kids will too. 'Whatever your views on LGBTQ rights and gender identity, barring teachers from even recognizing that gay people exist forces them to lie to their students and breaks down trust between students and educators. After all, millions of students nationwide have gay parents, siblings, friends, aunts, uncles and on and on. They watch gay celebrities on television and in movies. Many will identify as LGBTQ themselves. Barring the mention of reality doesn't make reality cease to exist.",
            "Sen. Jeff Brandes (R-FL) had proposed an amendment that attempted to remove the perceived stigmatization of LGBTQ people in the bill while still meeting DeSantis' objective. His amendment banned instruction of 'human sexuality' for children in third grade and under instead of singling out sexual orientation or gender identification. It had support from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates. But his Republican colleagues voted down the amendment. LGBTQ Floridians once hoped DeSantis could be an ally. Not anymore. 'Steve Contorno, CNN",
            "Republicans, in their eagerness to get the 'don't say gay' bill across the finish line, revived a repulsive, homophobic myth: That queer people are pedophiles who recruit children. 'The bill that liberals inaccurately call 'Don't Say Gay' would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,  Christina Pushaw, DeSantis' longtime press secretary, wrote over the weekend on Twitter. She followed up by saying that anyone who opposes the bill is 'probably a groomer.  The term 'groomer,  of course, is just another word for 'child molester,  as actual pedophiles are known to 'groom' their victims before assaulting them. But (I can't believe this needs to be said in the year 2022) there is no evidence that LGBTQ people molest children at a higher rate than straight-identified people.",
            "These measures are rooted in the anachronistic belief that discussions about gender and sexuality somehow endanger children. But for many LGBTQ kids, schools can be an important lifeline for information---and a source of comfort that they are not alone. In a recent survey, the Trevor Project found that 42 percent of LGBTQ youths seriously considered suicide in the past year. Eliminating mention of these topics will only isolate these children further and deprive students of a chance to learn about their identities and those of their peers. 'Proponents of such bills routinely invoke the bogeyman of school systems infringing on 'parental rights,  arguing that such conversations should be led by parents and families. Of course, parents have an important role to play, and educators should generally be mindful of parental concerns. These bills, however, are an intrusive attempt to restrict speech in schools. And just like efforts against the specter of critical race theory, they seek to expunge important truths about our history and world from classrooms."
