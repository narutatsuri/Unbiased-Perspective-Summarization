            "The talking point President Donald Trump and top administration officials are using to explain the abrupt dismissal of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire---namely, that his dismissal was required by law---doesn't add up. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien claimed Maguire had to go because he couldn't serve as acting director of national intelligence past March 11 due to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But Maguire could've stayed on as acting director of national intelligence indefinitely had Trump nominated someone to become Senate-confirmed before March 11. 'Also, if the Trump administration is really concerned about the March 11 cutoff, then appointing Grenell to the acting role won't address it, as he now faces the same deadline that Maguire did before his dismissal. Maguire's ouster may be part of Trump's broader effort to get rid of government officials he perceives as being insufficiently loyal.",
            "The New York Times reports that Trump was angry at Maguire because he was afraid Democrats would use the information about Russian interference against him. And I suppose he's right. Another alternative, of course, would be for Trump to do something about Russian interference, which would neuter any possible Democratic complaints. Apparently, though, that's out of the question. Don't you know there's an election coming up? 'Kevin Drum, Mother Jones",
            "Russian election meddling is not the only area where Trump doesn't want to hear the conclusions of his top spies. For weeks now, officials in the country's intelligence agencies, and in oversight committees on Capitol Hill, have been trying to determine the fate of the intelligence community's annual Worldwide Threat Assessment. as it has in past years, it contains the conclusion that Russia, not Ukraine, meddled in the 2016 U. S. elections in an effort to help Trump, and is doing so again this year. But as past ones have, this year's assessment also contains other conclusions that are at odds with the president. 'Officials familiar with the document say it contradicts Trump's stated positions on: the likelihood of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons program; the prospects that a 'maximum pressure' campaign will force Iran to abandon its nuclear efforts; whether ISIS remains a threat; and climate change as a threat to national security. The effort to block the release of the threat assessment cuts against more than a decade of increased transparency during which the report has been made public in redacted form.",
            "Regarding Grenell, 'he has little intelligence experience and has never run a large bureaucracy. Before he was dispatched to Berlin, he worked as a public affairs consultant and commentator for Fox News. Before that, he was a communications official in President George W. Bush's administration. He has been an aggressive public cheerleader for Mr. Trump, fiercely and frequently defending him on Fox News and on social media. That appears to be the qualification that truly matters to this president---especially when it comes to overseeing an intelligence community that Mr. Trump has always believed has been out to get him. 'Presidents have tended to shy away from politicizing national intelligence---or at least tried to avoid the perception of such politicization. But Mr. Trump has made clear that he will not tolerate any discussion of Russia's meddling in American politics, no matter how compelling the evidence. He is sending a very public message: In this White House, protecting Donald Trump's interests is what matters.",
            "The DNI must be seen as a neutral arbiter among America's vast intelligence community that ranges from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) to the FBI, DEA and intelligence units of the Departments of State, Energy, Homeland Security and Treasury. He or she must be a mediator, bringing often-conflicting people and ideas together to reach a consensus or at least a viable menu of choices for the president's final decision on life-or-death matters. But above all, this individual must be deeply conversant with the arcane language and practices, sources and methods that make up the core mission of the intelligence communities. Rick Grenell brings none of this to the table.",
            "Our allies won't trust us if our own officers face constant pressure to politicize intelligence. That means reporting streams will dry up, we won't get early warning on planned attacks and we will lose critical knowledge about the decisions adversaries are making that may not have consequences today, but could have huge ones in the next decade. It's impossible to know how many clues we will miss if our intelligence community is isolated from the world and the president's daily brief only reinforces what the administration wants to hear. I hope Mr. Grenell makes a careful assessment of the intelligence community's capacities and impressive work force before making further changes. How dangerous it would be if we lose the tip of the spear against those who would destroy us."

But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. 'A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn't changed since late April. More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.",
            "Although the true number of unemployed people is a matter of debate, the data show that as many as 27. 5 percent of Americans lost their job or had their hours scaled back as a result of the shutdowns. That's more than 30 million Americans, at a minimum, who were hit hard economically. We simply cannot sustain that level of economic catastrophe much longer. 'Rises in the coronavirus infection and hospitalization rates have to be put into context. We must minimize the potential loss of life, but public health measures must also be weighed against the cost of millions of ruined lives. Keeping the economy closed and the lockdowns tight would be fatal to America itself. To do this would be the public health equivalent of the famous quote from a dispatch during the Vietnam War: 'It was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it. ",
            "Maximum lockdowns were never a realistic long-term option. The end of our patience was never going to coincide with the end of the pandemic. Yes, warmer weather will probably help some, along with more Americans spending more time outdoors. In some parts of the country, lots of people are still wearing masks; in other parts of the country, not so much. Ending idiotic policies about returning still-contagious patients to nursing homes will help reduce the death rate considerably. 'But. the virus is still out there. The fact that people would rather play out an American version of China's Cultural Revolution, complete with public 'struggle sessions,  or go over footage of a cop shoving a senior citizen in Buffalo like it's the Zapruder film, or remove the television show Cops from the airwaves---because having camera crews ride along with police officers is somehow enabling police brutality---does not change any facts about the virus and its spread.",
            "The coronavirus has not disappeared, and the rules governing our response to it are still being applied to businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations. In Maryland, for example, outdoor religious services have been banned completely by Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich. And my church in northern Virginia has decided to hold off on in-person services, outdoors or indoors, because the regulations are too vague and too difficult to navigate. Where were these regulations during Saturday's protest? . 'Government officials cannot selectively restrict constitutional rights. Either the law applies to everyone, or it doesn't apply at all. In other words, if protesters have the right to gather, churches should have that right as well. Any other application of the law is hypocritical and unconstitutional.",
            "With coronavirus, government has been aggressive to excessive. When business owners have attempted to reopen ahead of government timelines, many have faced harsh responses. Government actions and reactions have been aimed at normal activities by otherwise law-abiding citizens. Meanwhile, government has been permissive to passive (at least initially) with protests. Here, government action has not been taken against people gathering en masse in violation of health orders, even when some of those protests turned to violent riots. 'The danger Democrats increasingly face is that Middle America and moderate voters will see these increasingly stark juxtapositions. Democrats need protests to end now---yesterday actually. The longer they last, the worse Democrats look, and the greater the likelihood that Middle America and moderate voters make a connection from current chaos, to coronavirus, to leftward campaign content---and break with Democrats."

If voters were looking for a Sanders alternative who looked like he could be commander in chief in this debate, Buttigieg made a very good case for himself.",

'Mr. Trump claims that he did nothing wrong, yet the White House refuses to let most of these people appear under oath. (Mr. Sondland himself defied orders not to testify from the White House and the State Department. ) It's worth emphasizing this point: All the witnesses whose testimony has been damaging to Mr. Trump have given that testimony under oath. All of those who we are led to believe would exonerate the president have so far refused to testify. If Mr. Trump truly believes he insisted on no conditions for the White House meeting and the aid for Ukraine, he has a clear choice: Let people testify. At this point it's hard to see what reason they have for continuing to refuse.",
            "The president's defenders have leaned into a version of Nunes's argument that Trump was just very interested in rooting out Ukrainian corruption. According to this line of argument, Trump's interest onlycoincidentally happened to dovetail with an investigation of his possible chief political rival in the 2020 election and in a conspiracy theory that might damage the results of the Mueller investigation. Sondland's testimony, though, demonstrates that even if you wanted to accept this absurd premise, the evidence and testimony don't show Trump seeking any sort of genuine investigation. Instead, according to Sondland, he strictly wanted the announcement of one. 'As others in the impeachment inquiry have previously testified, if Trump actually wanted an investigation of corruption by American citizens, then the Department of Justice was the appropriate place for that to start. If the DOJ needed help from the Ukrainians to conduct such a legitimate investigation, they could request that help through what's called a mutual legal assistance treaty. None of that ever happened. Instead, there were secret back-channels and deals and demands. As we continue to learn, a legitimate investigation was never what Trump wanted. What he wanted was help in his reelection campaign, and he was willing to leverage America's national security to get it.",

Legal experts previously told CNN that this is a critical distinction. Most legitimate investigations are done in secret, so as not to tip off the supposed criminals. But the intense focus on securing a public announcement from Zelensky demonstrates that the scheme was really designed to maximize the political benefit to Trump, instead of a good-faith effort to investigate corruption.",
            "The GOP defense is now this: Trump is exonerated, because it hasn't yet been nailed down beyond any doubt that Trumpdirectly commanded Sondland to tell Ukraine that the money was withheld for that corrupt purpose. Sondland unequivocally confirmed that Trump was using the White House meeting as leverage to get the investigations he wanted, and that numerous top officials were in on that corrupt scheme. Now that it has been established that Trump dangled a meeting to force an investigation of Biden, how likely is it that Trump suddenly didn'tintend to use the frozen military aid for that same purpose, at precisely the moment he was bothobsessing over that goal and was maximizing his leverage over Ukraine to its highest point yet?",
            "The hearings have demonstrated in detail the extent to which Trump conflates his personal grudges with America's interests, even when the former harms the latter, and how he allows those private grudges to dictate foreign policy decisions that impact multiple countries. A foreign policy driven by a person unwilling to govern his feelings, subordinate his grudges, or follow rules is not a policy at all. It's a puff of air, a set of whims. It's a vague hunch his yay-sayers must interpret and try to execute, and apologize for when he changes his mind and blames them for getting it wrong.",

It is true that no president has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process. But that just speaks to how rare it has been for a president to even get to the point we are at now. And while it is certainly true that there are people who would be upset by his removal from office, the far greater risk lies in allowing this president, with this explicitly illegal, immoral and unjust track record of abusing the power of his office for his personal electoral benefit, to participate in future elections. Doing so would deprive the people of their constitutional right to choose their leader in a free, open and fair election."

            "New hot spots are emerging in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. Some of that spike is probably the result of more testing. But what's so concerning is that the positive test rate is also increasing at the same time, up from less than 8 percent at the end of May to nearly 14 percent now. It is difficult to ignore that the places seeing surges in Covid-19 cases began to reopen businesses and other public spaces a few weeks ago. 'The nationwide protests over George Floyd's death, police violence, and structural racism have also been met with concerns that they would become superspreading events. According to the experts I spoke with, however, it is simply too early to know whether the coronavirus will spread widely because of the protests. And it is worth remembering the differences between outdoor and indoor exposure, the latter being much more dangerous; it could end up being the case that people got infected because they were arrested and put into a police van or jail cell with other people, not because they were outside protesting in a big crowd.",
            "Some argue that 'I've been a vocal supporter of these protests from their start. But what we should not tolerate, and what the scientific community cannot permit if it is to retain its credibility, is the abuse and manipulation of health expertise for political ends. One of two things is true; either 1) these protests will lead to a significant spike in coronavirus infections and deaths, in which case public health experts should reconcile that outcome with how they could have encouraged and endorsed them; or 2) it will not lead to such a spike, in which case it will appear that the months of extreme, draconian lockdowns---which caused great suffering and deprivation around the world---were excessive, misguided and unwarranted.",
            "Others note that 'The people who are marching in the streets right now are well aware of the risk of coronavirus transmission. They are not acting out of ignorance that needs to be corrected by public-health experts. As one protester in Minneapolis said, 'Yes, corona is happening. It's real, it's deadly. But racism kills way more lives'. Even if public-health experts did want to stop the protests, they almost certainly could not. Any public-health pronouncements to the hundreds of thousands of people marching around the U. S. and worldwide would be like shouting into a mighty wind. 'Many experts, and some public-health officials, have adopted a harm-reduction approach to the protests, accepting that they must happen and offering recommendations to help people protest as safely as possible. Others have gone further by handing out masks and other protective gear on-site. The decision reflects what public-health experts have always tried to do: maximize the health of the population across all aspects of life.",
            "Experts never said that eternal lockdowns were the only choice we had to combat the pandemic. They argued that once areas got the initial case spikes under control through widespread social distancing (with new cases decreasing over at least a two-week span), a new phase of control should begin with widespread testing and contact tracing. The initial lockdown period avoided the worst possible scenario, but the US didn't use that time to prepare for managing the pandemic in the future. And now we've wasted the weeks that have passed since reopening.

Why she thinks this will help salvage her failing campaign is beyond me. 'As for the attacks on Sanders, I question whether they will set him back much. For one thing, most of the attacks centered on electability. The argument wasn't so much that Sanders is wrong on policy, but rather that the boldness of his proposals make him unelectable and will bring down Democratic congressional candidates. Sanders deflected this line of attack by citing polls that show him running ahead of President Trump. Moreover, many Democrats admire Sanders for his boldness, just as they did in 2016.",

Like Donald Trump in 2016, Sanders is also in the enviable position of being able to tell the voters he's courting that all the attacks on him are just proof that he is upsetting the establishment. 'For the most part, Sanders was able to avoid getting stuck defending himself. He answered nearly every criticism by returning to a familiar riff about billionaires. (He's against them. ) That tack won't work if he's the nominee. Voters at large are much more hostile to socialism, at home and abroad, than Democratic voters are.

Or, in the case of Warren, too wrapped up in her misty water-colored memories of her triumph over Bloomberg last week to pay attention to the guy who is actually eating her lunch---the guy who has every reason to think (no matter what happens in South Carolina) that he is heading inexorably for the center stage in Milwaukee.",
            "There were three moments over the course of the night when Sanders and Buttigieg clashed in a serious, sustained way. In the first two, Buttigieg tried to make his point with the sort of rational 'Let's talk about that' lines that are his hallmark. And Sanders shouted at himover and over. Until Buttigieg eventually gave up and let Sanders have the floor. The third time this happened, Buttigieg forged ahead and didn't back down. But because he wasn't willing to raise his voice, Sanders shouted over him and drowned him out. This is Bernie's move. It's how he deals with being challenged. But ask yourself: Do you think Sanders is going to be better at dominance politics than Trump is? Because I'm not sure I'd like his chances in that matchup. 'Biden was feisty and sharp. He showed voters that he's a fighter and emphasized over and over the idea of getting things done. He hit Bernie early for having wanted to primary Barack Obama in 2012 and had a great line when asked about his support from African-Americans: 'I don't expect anything. I'm here to earn the vote. At this point, Biden is a clear underdog. But he sure looks like the strongest challenger to Sanders.",

He had some painfully unfunny planned jokes that landed with a thud, and when the topics turned to his weaknesses like stop-and-frisk and nondisclosure agreements with former employees, he looked tense. But Bloomberg had some good moments, and he's getting a bit more comfortable as the capitalist defender of charter schools and skeptic on marijuana legalization. The mood of the rest of the field is forcing Bloomberg to be the contrarian, which fits him. Bloomberg has few problems that can't be mitigated by another couple hundred million in television ads."

Some version of what DeSantis represents has the greatest odds of coaxing the party away from Trump and forging a new political synthesis that bears the unmistakable stamp of Trump while jettisoning his flaws. 'This critique of Trump wouldn't be that he tweeted foolish things or violated norms or disgraced himself after the 2020 election. It would be, for example, that he elevated Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, early in the pandemic and listened to his advice for too long. 'The case against Trump would be that, despite all his talk of building the border wall, he didn't get it done and left a desperately flawed immigration system intact, even though he had two years of a Republican Congress. That he rattled China's cage but didn't make fundamental changes to the U. S. trading relationship and said things that were much too complimentary of President Xi Jinping. That, finally, he lost to Joe Biden, a desperately flawed candidate who only made it into the White House because Trump made himself so unpopular.",

Trump outsourced his Covid policymaking to Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the healthcare bureaucracy. By the time it went sidewaysbecause it solely focused on eradicating a virus that was never getting eliminatedit was too late.

'This critique of Trump wouldn't be that he tweeted foolish things or violated norms or disgraced himself after the 2020 election. It would be, for example, that he elevated Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, early in the pandemic and listened to his advice for too long. 'The case against Trump would be that, despite all his talk of building the border wall, he didn't get it done and left a desperately flawed immigration system intact, even though he had two years of a Republican Congress. That he rattled China's cage but didn't make fundamental changes to the U. S. trading relationship and said things that were much too complimentary of President Xi Jinping. That, finally, he lost to Joe Biden, a desperately flawed candidate who only made it into the White House because Trump made himself so unpopular.",

'I have little sympathy for the Russian expressions of feigned outrage and a great deal of sympathy for President Biden who is making a point, and he is saying let's call things by their name,  Fried said. 'Biden's approach is seen in part as an effort to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who did not forcefully push back on Russia for interfering in U. S. elections. 'It means the tenor of the relations has changed. It means that we're not talking nice about Putin and the Kremlin anymore and were not papering over what they're doing,  said Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia under former President Obama. 'The Russians now will have to decide whether they want the tenor and the actual relationship to improve because they would have to stop all the things they are doing,  Farkas added.",
            "Over and over, Trump was presented with questions about the frequency with which critics of Putin met with untimely ends. And over and over, Trump demurred, either shrugging at others' concerns or equating Putin's behavior with that of the United States. 'He kills journalists that don't agree with him,  Joe Scarborough said to Trump. 'Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe,  Trump replied. 'Nobody has proven that he's killed anyone,  Trump said on ABC's 'This Week.  He offered an odd addendum: 'You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. It has not been proven that he's killed reporters. ",
            "Biden's conclusion is surely informed by the Kremlin's recent attempt to kill the Russian pro-democracy opposition figure Alexei Navalny last year and UK-based Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. Still, it's noteworthy to hear a president openly agree another world leader is a 'killer.  For example, when then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump the same question in 2017, Trump's response was: 'You think our country is so innocent?  and 'I do respect Putin. 'It's clear, then, that Biden is no fan of the Kremlin leader and is currently in no rush to improve US-Russia ties. However, he did conclude the Russia segment by noting both countries can work together when their interests align, citing the five-year extension of the New START nuclear arms control deal between the two countries earlier this year. Put together, the Biden administration will remain tough on Russia and Putin in particular. But if they can find areas of mutual interest, then Washington and Moscow might be able to put their differences aside---at least temporarily. 'Alex Ward, VoxSome note that, 'Generally speaking, when you call someone a killer, you follow it up with action, though as the recent case of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shows, that's not the case for everyone. Similarly to its handling of the investigation of MBS's role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration has declassified an intelligence finding that Russia's FSB security agency was behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has announced new sanctions against a number of Russian officials in response, but none targeting Putin himself. (The Russian president is in direct control of the FSB. ). 'Ultimately the 'killer' affair may have more to do with domestic politics in both countries than foreign policy. All Biden really did was repeat a story he's been telling for years, and concur with his own intelligence agencies' assessments of Putin's activities. But by choosing to do it, he did draw a contrast with Trump. 'The Trump years opened up a wide partisan gap in U. S. views on Putin, and it's hard to imagine Biden will suffer politically for criticizing the Russian leader, no matter how glibly. As for Putin, he's been using international crises to deflect attention from problems at home for decades now."

Still, it's noteworthy to hear a president openly agree another world leader is a 'killer.  For example, when then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump the same question in 2017, Trump's response was: 'You think our country is so innocent?  and 'I do respect Putin. 'It's clear, then, that Biden is no fan of the Kremlin leader and is currently in no rush to improve US-Russia ties. However, he did conclude the Russia segment by noting both countries can work together when their interests align, citing the five-year extension of the New START nuclear arms control deal between the two countries earlier this year. Put together, the Biden administration will remain tough on Russia and Putin in particular. But if they can find areas of mutual interest, then Washington and Moscow might be able to put their differences aside---at least temporarily. 'Alex Ward, VoxSome note that, 'Generally speaking, when you call someone a killer, you follow it up with action, though as the recent case of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shows, that's not the case for everyone. Similarly to its handling of the investigation of MBS's role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration has declassified an intelligence finding that Russia's FSB security agency was behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has announced new sanctions against a number of Russian officials in response, but none targeting Putin himself. (The Russian president is in direct control of the FSB. ). 'Ultimately the 'killer' affair may have more to do with domestic politics in both countries than foreign policy. All Biden really did was repeat a story he's been telling for years, and concur with his own intelligence agencies' assessments of Putin's activities. But by choosing to do it, he did draw a contrast with Trump. 'The Trump years opened up a wide partisan gap in U. S. views on Putin, and it's hard to imagine Biden will suffer politically for criticizing the Russian leader, no matter how glibly. As for Putin, he's been using international crises to deflect attention from problems at home for decades now.",

            "Not one witness offered any direct evidence that President Trump did anything clearly impeachable. No one heard him order a quid pro quo, in which Ukraine would gin up 'dirt' on Joe Biden in exchange for US aid or a White House meeting. Not one offered a convincing reason why Trump's interest in having Ukraine probe potential corruption warrants impeachment, even if it was part of quid pro quo. Fact is, Ukrainians were involved in the 2016 election, particularly in the investigation into Paul Manafort. And payments to Biden's son Hunter by notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma do reek.",
            "The claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election 'is supported by significant evidence. It includes public professions of support for Clinton and opposition to Trump by Ukrainian officials. It includes acknowledgments by Ukrainian investigators that their Obama administration counterparts encouraged them to investigate Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bolstering this theory is the fact that Ukrainian officials leaked information damaging to Manafort (a ledger of payments, possibly fabricated) that forced Manafort's ouster from the Trump campaign, triggering waves of negative publicity. 'A Ukrainian court, in late 2018, concluded that two Ukrainian officials meddled in the election. And in 2018 House testimony, Nellie Ohr---who worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign opposition research firm that produced the lurid and discredited Steele dossier---conceded that a pro-Clinton Ukrainian legislator was a Fusion informant. When Republicans and most Trump supporters refer to evidence of Ukrainian collusion in the 2016 election, it is this collusion theory that they are speaking about. This theory is in no way mutually exclusive with the finding that Russia hacked the DNC accounts---it has nothing to do with the hacking. There is nothing illogical in believing both that Russia hacked the Democrats and that Ukraine supported the Democrats.",
            "Some agree that 'the Democrats have their quid pro quo. Even if Trump never explicitly stated that military aid was dependent on Ukraine's investigations, Sondland said that 'everyone was in the loop' and acted under the impression that that was, in fact, the situation. Sondland seems to be making a calculated bet that Trump won't walk away from impeachment unscathed. Just look at how many times he's changed his story. First, he insisted that there was no quid pro quo. Then, he admitted he had actually communicated the quid pro quo. And now, Sondland is throwing the White House under the bus and claiming that he knew of but was powerless to stop a quid pro quo. Sondland's testimony proves that Trump's motivations were personal and that the president did put U. S. national security interests at risk for the sake of political gain.",
            "Yet many argue that 'this isn't a quid pro quo that comes close to meeting the definition of bribery. It's another case of Mr. Trump's volatile policy-making based on personal impulse or prejudice, but it's not an impeachable offense. Sondland's account essentially confirms that Mr. Trump had a negative view of Ukraine, was reluctant to keep supplying U. S. aid, and asked Mr. Sondland and others to work with Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce that he was opening an anti-corruption probe. Democrats might have advanced their cause with hearings and a censure resolution. Instead, they have unleashed the dogs of impeachment without impeachable offenses."

At best, she was complicit and, yes, rather weak. 'Editorial Board, New York Times",
            "Nielsen carried out 'Trump's ghastly family separation policy at the southern border. and designed a plan that strictly limited the number of asylum-seekers allowed to enter the United States. And she implemented what was ultimately ruled to be an unlawful policy to prevent immigrants from applying for asylum if they entered the country illegally. But Nielsen drew the line at Trump's 'clearly illegal' demands, including 'blocking all migrants from seeking asylum.  She also reportedly refused to resume family separations, despite Trump's entreaties, because she did not want to violate a court order. 'If Nielsen and other DHS officials who were recently fired were not sufficiently extreme, it is alarming to consider what might come after them. Both bent the law as far as they could to implement hugely controversial and frequently vicious policies to further Trump's nativist goals. It wasn't enough for the president.

And McAleenan refers to the migrants arriving at the border not as scammers looking to cheat their way into the country but as 'vulnerable families' who need more humanitarian treatment. He has urged a fast and responsible screening process that will let true asylum seekers start their new lives in the United States once a court rules on their claims. Whether that is what the president and Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, are looking for on a long-term basis is not clear.",

As secretary of homeland security, a lot of things can happen on your watch: A botched response to a hurricane, or a serious cyber attack, or a major terrorist assault, or rising numbers of migrant families trying to cross the southern border. 'Almost a century ago one such desperate migrant, Mary Anne MacLeod, left the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Europe, to find work as a servant in New York. Mary later married Fred Trump. They had five children, including a son named Donald. Trying to dissuade migrants such as Mary Anne MacLeod from leaving countries where they see no future to seek their fortune in the United States is likely beyond the ken of any secretary of homeland security.",
            "US immigration law is a balance between the desire to minimize unauthorized entry into the United States and the desire to protect vulnerable people who may be fleeing harm and persecution. Both US and international law prohibit the US from refusing entry to people who are in danger of persecution in their home countries; both US statute and court settlements offer extra due-process protections to asylum seekers, children, and families. Trump's anger at Nielsen is really anger at this delicate balance. if Trump wants a DHS secretary who will stop people from setting foot on US soil, none of the options will satisfy him."

More important, Grenell himself has said he will only be acting director, and that he expects the president will soon nominate someone else for the position.

            "The authoritarian impulse has been a hallmark of DeSantis's tenure since the beginning. Last April, he signed an 'anti-rioting' law that was one of the most sweeping attacks on the right to protest in memory. Among other things, it offers civil liability protection to those who mow down protesters with their cars, and would allow peaceful protesters to be charged with a felony if other people at a protest they attended committed an act of violence. 'Last week Raul Pino, the director of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County, was 'placed on administrative leave, and the Florida Department of Health is conducting an inquiry to determine if any laws were broken in this case.  Because he encouraged public health workers to be vaccinated. Pino didn't impose a mandate on anyone. His email was asking, pleading, begging people to get vaccinated---not requiring them to do so. 'DeSantis has called Florida 'the freest state in these United States'. Unless, that is, the freedom you're interested in involves encouraging people to get vaccinated, protecting your employees and customers from a pandemic, teaching history honestly, voting, protesting or anything else Republicans might not want you to do.",

'And yet the nature of the feud itself says a great deal about how much the politics of Covid-19 have shifted in the year since Trump left office. Trump has, over the past year, beenat least by the dismal standards of the righta hype man for vaccines. DeSantis, meanwhile, has recently embraced vaccine skepticism and refused to disclose his own status. The result is. a rare instance in which Trump is 'out-of-step with the hardline elements of his party's base.  It also points to the growing potency of vaccine hesitancy on the right, as well as a potential fault line in upcoming elections in 2022 and 2024."

But it's what Nancy Pelosi wanted. That's political hardball. It's why Pelosi became speaker twice, why she got things done for two Democratic presidents in the role, and why she has twice now found herself losing the majority.",

During the Bush era, she fought back efforts by progressives to 'defund' the Iraq War, fearing that it would backfire by making Democrats come off as anti-troop. During the Obamacare fight, she helped persuade progressives to vote for a final version of the bill that did not include a public option.",

She lost the gavel in the 2010 midterms, and failed to regain it in three subsequent national elections, including the one in which Barack Obama narrowly won re-election to the presidency. She regained it in the 2018 midterms, but then managed to be the first Speaker in long memory to lose seats while her party elected a new president. As Speaker, Pelosi will go out with a won-loss record in elections of 4-6.",

However, Pelosi raises tons of money for other House Democrats, and if she assumes that role, she likely will continue to control campaign cash, or at least influence its direction. A diplomatic post in Rome might be a great lark, but it will end Pelosi's ability to control outcomes in the House."

Almost literally the first thing Biden did in office was to extend an arms agreement with Putin despite US suspicions and evidence of Russian cheating on such treaties. Biden calls it a demonstration that we can 'walk and chew gum at the same time for places where it's in our mutual interest to to work together.  Putin likely sees it as more reason for impunity.

It's a preferable strategy for the Kremlin in three specific ways. First, it allows for a personal riposte to Biden's attack on Putin's character. 'Second, it plays to concerns in other governments that Biden is, perhaps, not as sharp as he once was. That is relevant in terms of the trust and confidence foundation, which ultimately underpins the U. S. -led liberal international order.

It's a preferable strategy for the Kremlin in three specific ways. First, it allows for a personal riposte to Biden's attack on Putin's character. 'Second, it plays to concerns in other governments that Biden is, perhaps, not as sharp as he once was.

But 'I can't guarantee everything that's going on in the Wuhan lab, we can't do that,  Dr. Fauci said Wednesday in an interview with NewsNation Now. Dr. Fauci also said this week that his emails 'are really ripe to be taken out of context' and that 'you don't really have the full context.  That may be true.

            "There's no question that organized criminal elements, including drug-trafficking organizations and Colombian guerrilla groups, have penetrated state institutions in Venezuela. The allegations are not surprising given the clear corruption and authoritarianism of the Maduro regime, and they are serious. But the Trump administration's rhetoric clearly isn't. Venezuela is not a major transit country for drugs bound for the United States. 'According to the U. S. interagency Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB), 210 metric tons of cocaine passed through Venezuela in 2018. By comparison, in the same year about 10 times as much cocaine (2, 370 metric tons) passed through Colombia, and seven times as much cocaine (1, 400 metric tons) passed through Guatemala. So why is the Trump administration now raising the alarm about Venezuela 'flooding' the United States with cocaine, especially when the White House allowed anti-corruption efforts to die in more significant transit countries such as Honduras and Guatemala?",
            "If there were anything that could force the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro and his opposition to work together, it might have been the coronavirus. With the pandemic closing in on a country woefully ill-prepared to confront it, the president's opponents had begun to test the waters of negotiating with him, with the hope that cooperation on a plan to fight the virus might lead to wider political agreement or eventually even new elections. But this past week, the United States torpedoed that possibility. 'President Trump has from early in his administration been eager to undermine Maduro as a way to win votes in southern Florida, where many refugees from Venezuela and its close ally Cuba tend to vote for conservative Republicans. He has been frustrated his team has not made more progress in ousting the socialist leader. 'It's difficult not to see an explicit political motive here in the indictments: maximize all possible pressure on the regime when they are hanging by a thread,  said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan think tank in Washington.",
            "Mr. Maduro is already using Mr. Trump's move to bolster his support domestically and internationally. Countries including Mexico and Argentina, which are sympathetic to the Venezuelan regime, may call the charges exaggerated and cite international law to defy Washington. Mr. Maduro will keep denying the accusations, and claim the action against him is typical American interventionist meddling and extraterritorial application of its domestic legislation. 'Manuel Noriega was a U. S. toady before the George H. W. Bush's administration turned on him. Saddam Hussein bore the brunt of two American invasions before his execution. It does not seem likely that Mr. Trump would be willing to pay such a steep price for Mr. Maduro's demise. The Cubans, who play a crucial role in supporting the Maduro regime, have some experience in dealing with American hostility, warranted or not. The Castro brothers have outlasted 12 American presidents; Hugo Chavez and Mr. Maduro have outlasted four, if we include most of Mr. Trump's first term. The new measure, however valid on its merits, is not likely to alter the scoreboard.",
            "Meanwhile, 'The administration has shown little interest in measures to help Iran and Venezuela address the pandemic. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is right that Iran and Venezuela have squandered tens of billions of dollars on corruption, repression, and other malign activities that could have been used to fight the pandemic. But the reality right now is that sanctions should not compound human suffering by denying Iran and Venezuela the chance to purchase needed medical supplies, especially since dedicated humanitarian payment mechanisms can ensure that the funds are used only for that specific purpose.",
            "On paper, the unilateral U. S. sanctions say that medical supplies are exempt. But this is an illusion. Neither Venezuela nor Iran can easily buy medical supplies, nor can they easily transport it into their countries, nor can they use them in their largely public sector health systems. If any firm trades with Venezuela's public sector, it could face secondary sanctions. When the U. S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked about the half-million Iraqi children who died because of U. S. sanctions, she said that those deaths were a price worth paying. They were certainly not a price that the Iraqis wanted to pay, nor now the Iranians or the Venezuelans, or indeed the majority of humankind."

Maduro has been steadily escalating against Guaido this year, so increased questions were being asked as to how resolute the Trump administration was in its support for the interim president. These indictments confidently answer those questions. it is also important that the indictments do not focus on active uniform military officers who are heavily involved in the drug trade. The intended U. S. implication in turning a blind eye to these officers is that generals who now abandon Maduro can hope to avoid future U. S. criminal sanctions. 'But these indictments alone will not remove Maduro from power. More U. S. action will be needed if the generals are to decide to move against the pretender president. That means the U. S. should take decisive action, as requested by Guaido, to prevent Maduro's oil supplies from reaching Cuba. If Cuba is forced to abandon Maduro, his ability to intimidate and consolidate the military into his continued support will collapse. Still, these indictments are, in and of themselves, good news.

            "The dual problem of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in oil prices have managed to create in two short weeks what a concerted American sanctions campaign could not achieve, which is a potential knockout blow to the Venezuelan legal economy. The illicit economy in illegal gold and drug trafficking, of course, will continue to grow at an alarming rate. The United States needs to stay vigilant against the regime and trust the external conditions improve its odds of success. Under these conditions, if the American government fails to achieve its goals of deposing Maduro and imposing democratic elections in Venezuela, then it might never achieve them in the end.",
            "Some, however, argue that 'With the coronavirus epidemic now beginning to impact an under-resourced and unprepared Venezuelan hospital system, regime change in Caracas would serve no purpose other than introducing a greater degree of anarchy inside the country. That, in turn, would result in more refugee flows, more humanitarian disaster within Venezuela's borders, and more destabilization in the region at large. 'The best way Washington can contribute is by getting out of the way, allowing its Latin American partners to take the lead in facilitating a diplomatic formula acceptable to both sides, and providing humanitarian aid to neighboring countries (like Colombia) that are in the unenviable position of managing the migration flows. Filing criminal charges against Nicolas Maduro may be emotionally satisfying for the investigators and prosecutors who have been working on this case. But in terms of foreign policy, this action seeks to replace one problem with another, a mistake that will have unintended humanitarian, political, and diplomatic repercussions."

But it's also hard not to wonder why the situation couldn't have been defused without Adam being shot. This was a child, a 13-year-old. A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon? . 'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, 'despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. 'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.",
            "The post-Floyd reckoning in the media has emphasized the need for journalists to look skeptically at claims from police and other officials following a killing, as they may come undone when more facts come to light. 'Shortly after the March 29 death of Toledo, a Cook County prosecutor claimed that Toledo was shot while holding a gun in his right hand. But body camera footage released on Thursday suggests this claim was inaccurate, as it appears to show the boy unarmed and with his hands raised when he was shot. Officials also described the incident as an 'armed confrontation,  without noting that Toledo had complied with officer instructions to drop the firearm and put his hands up.",
            "Justice for Adam Toledo requires investments in our Black and brown communities and disinvestments in policing. One would be a proposal by the Chicago-based, Black youth-led GoodKids MadCity collective called the Peace Book, which would create neighborhood peace commissions with resources sufficient to meet community needs. The resources include funds for positive youth spaces, political and art education, mental health treatment, restorative justice, and conflict resolution services. The Peace Book could operate with a diversion of just 2 percent, or $35 million, from the CPD's budget. 'Second, the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance, sponsored by Chicago Democratic Socialist Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and backed by a diverse, citywide coalition, would prohibit CPD officers from responding to people in mental health crises and instead fund community-based mental health professionals. Similar programs in Oregon both reduce police violence and better serve community needs.",

A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon? . 'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, 'despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. 'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.",

            "Reports that President Donald Trump wants to send 5, 000 more troops to the Southern border, at first, come as a shock. It's a startlingly high number. To put it in perspective, NATO recently deployed 4, 500 troops in the Baltic nations to deter and repel a Russian tank assault. How many troops could possibly be needed to stave off an unarmed caravan of refugees walking up through Mexico? ",
            "According to former Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, this is 'a misuse of active duty military. To say this isn't a political stunt is misleading the public.",
            "The Trump administration has produced no evidence to support the president's repeated claims that criminals are in the caravan. Moreover Trump's claim that 'you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process' does not make sense. Many of the caravan members plan to request asylum, which requires that a person already be in the United States. ",
            "No doubt some of the caravan members will weigh the odds and decide they have a better chance of sneaking over illegally. But if even a few thousand were to try it, they would pose no unusual challenge to the Border Patrol---which apprehended nearly 6, 000 people every week last year crossing from Mexico. 'It's worth noting that while data specifically on refugees and those granted asylum are hard to come by. the New American Economy Research Fund looked at the 10 cities with the highest rates of refugee arrivals and found that 'nine out of 10 of the communities actually became considerably more safe, both in terms of their levels of violent and property crime'.",
            "Some posit that 'the United States has sabotaged itself. The migration crisis stems not from foreign nations duping the United States but rather from American economic development policies. that have exacerbated the poverty, despair and violence such policies were supposed to alleviate. ",
            "Others ask, 'What do we do when the caravan gets here? And more saliently: What do we do if many more caravans show up behind it? . This is not a passing crisis. It is the new normal, and its optics do nothing but intensify the cultural panic that is turning much of the West to authoritarianism as a response. Democrats can't keep dodging immigration as a real issue."

            "Mike Bloomberg Is hacking your attention. There are his ubiquitous television, YouTube and Facebook ads. There are his tweets, many of which are weird enough to generate the right amount of viral confusion or are pugnacious enough toward Donald Trump to provoke the ire of the presidential Twitter feed. Then there are the influencers. Starting this week the Bloomberg campaign enlisted the help of a number of popular meme-makers to create sponsored Instagram content for the candidate. 'On Twitter, where some Democratic hopefuls have adopted a 'they go low, we go high' mentality, Bloombergians have instead opted to wade into the mud and wrestle with Mr. Trump's Twitter feed. For citizens looking for a movement or big, structural change or even just a genuine vision for the future of the country, the strategy is disheartening---just another brazen attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator instincts of the internet that leaves a sinking feeling that shameless memes, Twitter dunks and toxic screaming into the algorithmic void have become politics as usual. Or maybe it's always been this way. After all, what is politics if not a long, well-funded attempt at hacking people's attention?",
            "What's interesting here is that, even if Bloomberg doesn't win the nomination---which he very likely will not---this digital ad spending could end up mattering, anyway. That's because Bloomberg has pledged to spend a large fortune to dislodge Trump even if he's not the Democratic nominee. 'That a democratic socialist could end up as the nominee, even as Democrats end up relying in part on billionaire Bloomberg's money to fend off what may be the largest disinformation warfare campaign in U. S. history---one partly enabled by the threat the Big Tech oligarchy poses to democracy---is another measure of just how weirdly unsettled our politics are right now. It also hints at the odd compromises that might be necessary to survive the current crisis.",
            "Throw them up against the wall. It is impossible for me to imagine that those words would have rolled off Bloomberg's tongue had he been speaking to a room full of young black and brown men. Or, if people who looked like members of his own family faced that kind of scrutiny as they moved about their communities. In order for people to unfold their arms, he is going to have to face the wall of justified anger and absorb it at full blast. He has to be willing to talk about race and racism, not once or twice but with consistency and courage. 'He has to be willing to address the mind-set that created stop-and-frisk and keeps some version of it alive. And that means bringing cops to the table and pushing the leadership and the rank-and-file in blue to interrogate the social and racial factors that lead to disproportionate levels of scrutiny aimed at black and brown men. That will not be easy. But it is worth the risk. A leader who can create a pathway toward a model of policing that seeks justice, while facing up to historical injustice, would be doing a great thing for all of America.",
            "'Ninety-five percent of murders, murderers and murder victims' are male minorities between 16 to 25, Bloomberg said in 2015. This is actually not true -- not in New York City, and not nationwide. Lots of Democrats made significant mistakes in the 1990s when it came to being tough on crime -- mistakes that were readily apparent by the mid-2000s. But You cannot be the leader of a diverse, justice-oriented party when you said, just a few years ago -- well after we well knew just how damaging over-policing and mass incarceration are -- that 'the way you get the guns out of the kid's hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them. ",
            "Some, however, argue that 'Bloomberg's mistakes. have to be weighed against a record of courageously speaking out and devoting enormous personal resources to virtually every progressive cause---gun control, abortion rights, climate change, Planned Parenthood, education reform for predominantly minority schools, affordable housing, income inequality and tax reform. And he has vowed as president to focus on building black wealth, not just ending poverty. Sitting here today, Bloomberg---paired with a progressive vice-presidential candidate who can appeal to Sanders's voters---has the best chance to carry the day."

            "Critics of the bill, however, posit that 'Unable to pass the federal liability shield legislation on its own, lawmakers from both parties have now come together in a grand show of post-election bipartisan unity to help their corporate donors create a hostage situation that's something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie. Their proposal predicates long overdue and desperately needed unemployment assistance on the condition that corporations are given a get-out-of-jail-free card. corporate managers were allegedly betting on the number of COVID deaths that would happen at a meatpacking plant. 'With liability shields, those same employers will know that they can get away with all kinds of cost-slashing and corner-cutting that endangers workers and denies them access to basic protective gear. In other words, corporations will know they can drive the COVID body count ever higher, and they won't even have to worry about being called into a courtroom to answer for their crimes. 'The shield would strip frontline workers of their last remaining legal tool to protect themselves in the workplace---at the same that time the unemployment system is designed to financially punish those workers if they refuse to return to unsafe workplaces during the pandemic.",
            "Coming in at just over $900 billion, the bipartisan proposal moved substantially away from what Democrats want (around $2 trillion) and a whole lot closer to what Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) has pushed for (around $500 billion). Naturally, the Senate majority leader responded to this dramatic move in his direction by immediately announcing that this compromise is a non-starter. 'By reaching this agreement with Republicans, a group of Democratic senators made it easier for McConnell to demand that they move still further in his direction once he tries to jam them with his proposal in the upcoming funding bill. Now the 'compromise' position has moved to a point between $900 billion and $500 billion. Which raises a question: Is there any serious utility at all in Democratic senators seeking compromise with Republicans, even ones who appear to be acting in good faith, if there's simply no chance that it will meaningfully influence McConnell, and if it's preordained that McConnell will simply seize on this to his tactical advantage?"

The public is mostly saying they want to vote for any Democrat, and the strongest pattern so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than the more obscure ones. Rather than being either complacent or paralyzed by fear, Democrats should probably take a modest amount of reassurance from Trump's bad polls and try worrying about everything else for a minute.",

If members of the Democratic donor class are putting their faith in Biden, it's hard to blame them.

Buttigieg is, at heart, a liberal internationalist who is looking beyond interventions to challenges posed by great powers, bridging the gap between the Obama and Clinton wings of his party. He fears that, left untended, threats to liberty abroad will ultimately threaten liberty at home. Buttigieg still has a lot of work to do to unpack what this means, but if he sticks to it and is bolder than he was on Tuesday, he may be able to articulate the alternative he promised.",
            "Others contend, 'Buttigieg wants to set a generous narrative of national identity against Trump's cramped and cruel vision, and against the progressive hostility to any national identity at all. It won't be easy. He speaks of the compassion of his Indiana neighbors toward refugees, their desire to be part of 'a greater project' than just America First. But the strongest political emotions of the moment are fear, disillusionment, and hatred. As impressive as he is personally, Buttigieg hasn't yet found the words, the music, and the policies to make his appeal convincing.  George Packer, The Atlantic"

One moment, they're casting him as a Stalinesque puppetmaster; the next he is a senile, powerless figurehead being manipulated by others behind the scenes.

'Fauci certainly cast doubt on the lab leak theory.

There is quite simply no evidence that Fauci was delivered anything amounting to solid evidence of a lab leak.",
            "Though the lab leak theory has been embraced more on the political right, Rutgers University biologist Richard Ebright says it was Republican hawks under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney who pushed for the NIH to fund more of the sort of research that could have both health and bioweapons applications---or could be seen as defensive against biological attack. And it was academics on the left who warned this work could endanger our safety in the name of improving it. 'If Fauci owes the public an explanation for anything, it's why he approved funding for research that potentially made viruses more dangerous---so-called gain of function research. Though Fauci has been unofficially anointed America's 'top expert in infectious disease' by the press, his real job is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In that capacity, he's not above criticism. He's approved funding of projects on viruses that other scientists have deemed too risky to be worth doing. 'Faye Flam, BloombergRegarding Fauci's initial advice not to wear masks, 'In February and early March of 2020, anything Covid-19-related was unclear even to health professionals, and a leading line of discourse was that Americans should not wear masks because they weren't thought to be effective in screening out viral particles shed by others. While that information continues to be believed accurate. it was eventually found that encouraging everyone to wear masks helped to prevent the actively infected from spreading the shed viral particles as easily to others. 'There was also an effort to keep the panic-driven public from buying all available masks and putting health care workers at risk of running out of supplies. During a June 3 CNN interview addressing the emails, Fauci reiterated that if he had all the information he had today, his advice from early in the pandemic would be drastically different, and that masks do in fact work. But it doesn't look like Fauci's explanation will ease the backlash."

DHS is charged with protecting the country from terrorism, preparing for and responding to emergencies of all sorts, coordinating the federal government's cyber-security efforts, and assisting state and local law-enforcement in countless ways. The department is home to the three immigration services. but it is also home to the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Protective Service, and more. 'In considering possible replacements for Nielsen, the president and his advisers should keep in mind that the Secretary of DHS is not a kind of minister of immigration. The person in charge of that department needs to have some background or capacity for the much broader set of challenges involved in the job."

Some of those lines were delivered in gift-wrapped sound bites for the Trump campaign. All of which is why Biden, though he looked better than usual in this format, probably won't want to debate Bernie Sanders again.",
            "Biden's new position on immigration is that if he is elected, no one will be deported in his first 100 days as president. And he said a person who enters the U. S. illegally won't be deported even if the person has a criminal record in any foreign country, unless the immigrant is convicted of a felony in the U. S. That position on deportations is an extreme one that could cost Biden votes even in Hispanic communities among people who fear that new neighbors who have committed crimes elsewhere might commit crimes again in the U. S. 'Then Biden sought to appease the environmental community by pledging that there would be 'no new fracking' if he becomes president, and also said he would ban drilling for fossil fuels on public lands. Given the importance of fracking to the economies of key electoral states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Colorado, Biden is opening himself up to relentless attacks by Trump in the fall that he is anti-jobs and that he would make America dependent on imported oil and natural gas.",

But here's the thing: It's very sensible to have targeted government-guaranteed coverage for the coronavirus and not for broken bones. For one, the coronavirus looks like a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Second, it's incredibly contagious, and thus there are large externalities, and that's the problem here. In other words, there's a strong case for government action in this specific case---it's a lot simpler than a revolution.",

According to the poll, Trump would barely edge out Biden among white voters, 47% to 46%. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 20 points among white voters---and this was not unheard of. Mitt Romney beat the Obama-Biden ticket by 20 points among whites in 2012, and John McCain won whites by 12 points in 2008. 'Quinnipiac also found that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , would get within eight points of Trump among white voters. Not since 1996, when Bill Clinton came within two points of Bob Dole, has any Democrat come within single digits among whites. It's just hard to see Harris having the best performance among whites in 24 years running against Trump, who has built his successful electoral career around white identity politics.",

An Associated Press poll published on 10/25/16, two weeks before the election, gave the race to Clinton by 13 points, the same margin that Quinnipiac gives to Biden today.",
            "Iowa Democratic voters have seen and heard much more from the contenders than almost any other state, and thus are much less likely to base their preferences largely on name identification.

Mitt Romney beat the Obama-Biden ticket by 20 points among whites in 2012, and John McCain won whites by 12 points in 2008. 'Quinnipiac also found that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , would get within eight points of Trump among white voters. Not since 1996, when Bill Clinton came within two points of Bob Dole, has any Democrat come within single digits among whites. It's just hard to see Harris having the best performance among whites in 24 years running against Trump, who has built his successful electoral career around white identity politics.",
