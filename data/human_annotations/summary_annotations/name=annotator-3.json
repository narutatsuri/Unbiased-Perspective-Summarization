Nearly 1. 4 million people have already cast ballots in Harris, setting a new record for the county.

In 2016, Harris spent roughly $4 million on administering its elections. Under Hidalgo's leadership, the county pumped that budget up to $31 million: Enough money to triple the number of early voting sites in the county, and keep some locations open 24 hours during the final days of early voting. no matter how the final vote tally shakes out, the existing data already offers Democrats one vital lesson: Obscure local elections can have enormous consequences."
