The other analysis---the 'Missing White Voter' thesis---was grounded in actual data. It said the problem was that the GOP of the Bush family and Mitt Romney had turned off working-class whites to the point that they disengaged. Put another way, the GOP establishment in 2012 said the party could win by becoming more like George H. W. Bush; the deeper analysis said it could win if it became more like Ross Perot.

Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tried to tamp down the story of the migrant caravan then traveling through Mexico, calling President Trump's focus on it a distraction from health care. Pelosi's Democrats retook the Rust Belt districts that Donald Trump had won in 2016. She must have watched the Democratic primary debates in horror."
