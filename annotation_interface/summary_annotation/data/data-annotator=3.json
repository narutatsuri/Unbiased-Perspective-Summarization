ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nPresident Trump has a clear path to 270 electoral votes and he's busy earning each and every one of them. I believe the president will carry Texas, Indiana and all the other reliably red states for his first 163 electoral votes. In 2016, his road to victory ran through Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. In 2020, this path remains intact, with the addition of Georgia and Arizona. With repeat victories in these states, plus the electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska's 2nd Congressional Districts, that brings President Trump's tally to 260 electoral votes---just 10 votes shy of the magic number of 270. 'Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin has 10. In this scenario, with the president sitting at 260 electoral votes, he needs to win just one of these three states to prevail. The president is also on offense and actively campaigning in Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire---states he narrowly lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016. To put a fine point on it, he only lost these three states by approximately 74, 000 votes combined.\nFlorida went for Trump in '16 by a mere 1. 2 points. He's been trailing in the polls there, but Trump's popularity with Hispanic voters has been surging, so look for Florida to stay---barely---red. Minnesota, meanwhile, went for Clinton in 2016 by less than two points, and a long summer of urban violence in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police may lead to a 2020 law-and-order win here for Trump. The same is true of neighboring Wisconsin, where violence also flared in Kenosha. 'Early voting generally favors the Democrats, but in several states Trump needs to win, including Florida and North Carolina, Republicans are closing the gap. The good news for Trump is that if he can win Nevada and hold on to Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Arizona and Georgia, he can afford to lose Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota and still cross the finish line with at least 275 electoral votes. In the weird year of 2020, that's as good as a landslide. 'Michael Walsh, New York PostIn Florida, 'Democrats need to run up the score in Miami-Dade to have any hope of winning the state's 29 Electoral College votes, and so far the Biden campaign's turnout isn't even keeping up with Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 effort.\nPolling and analytics only take campaigns so far. They have to ask voters to participate, and keep following up, with effective community-based efforts. The RNC and the Trump campaign has used that model throughout the campaign, tracking and targeting voters who might need extra encouragement to get to the polls and (hopefully) calculating their messages in the local context of each community. 'It's far too late to launch an effective GOTV Get-out-the-vote effort now, no matter how much money the Biden campaign pours into the effort. It takes months to build the kind of contacts and networks that will effectively motivate low-propensity voters to the polls. It takes weeks just to identify the people who can even make contact with those voters. Team Biden bet that an air war would win in a pandemic. So far, it looks like they're going to lose, at least in Florida---and the fact that Biden showed up in Minnesota today hints that it's failing even in safer states.\nThe Commerce Department released the U. S. gross domestic product number for the third quarter, showing growth rate of around 33 percent. The economy is turning around, playing to Trump's strength. The president has made significant outreach to minorities, and a relative handful of Black voters switching from Democrat to Republican could help him secure states like Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. Not to mention that Trump---unlike Biden---is actually campaigning for the job. 'Pollsters insist their surveys have been adjusted from 2016 to include more demographics that support Trump---though they may harbor new flaws. They are still unlikely to capture the vast enthusiasm gap between Trump and Biden voters and fail to pick up the 'shy Trump voters, ---people afraid to admit they back Trump---who may be shyer than ever. . 'The shy voter phenomenon could prove even more pronounced in 2020 than in 2016. You could at least explain not voting for Clinton. She was unlikable to so many. Though inspiring fewer strong feelings, Biden is, at least, not as easy to despise. What's more, Trump has been vilified for the past four years, giving voters less of an excuse to admit they're still voting for him. This could be particularly true for Black and Latino voters. 'Keith Koffler, NBC NewsSome caution that 'the final national polls in 2016 were pretty accurate. There were some big misses in state polling (Wisconsin most of all) but national polls on average had Clinton winning by around three points when in reality she won by two. Trump can't win the electoral college if Biden wins the national popular vote this time by, say, seven. it'll take a much bigger polling screw-up this time for Trump to win than it took in 2016.\n\nRight:\nBiden leads in all the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016 by more than 5 points. He is also ahead in a bunch of contests that Trump won in 2016. even if Biden were to win just the states where he led by 5 points or more, he'd still get over the 270 electoral vote mark. More interesting is what happens if you look at the specific state errors that occurred in 2016. The errors were biggest in the Great Lake (Rust Belt) states. They tended to be considerably smaller in the Sun Belt. As The New York Times' Nate Cohn points out, Biden would get more than 300 electoral votes if the 2016 errors repeated themselves exactly in 2020. 'Finally Biden's ahead by 9 to 10 points nationally. Clinton was up by 3 to 4 points in the final polls of 2016 and took the popular vote by 2 points, a small error. Previous calculations indicate Trump probably can't win in the Electoral College if he loses by more than 4 to 5 points nationally. In order to win, Trump would need to benefit from a much bigger polling error than four years ago.\nIn Pennsylvania, Clinton's unfavorable rating was 56 percent, as measured by an October 2016 Quinnipiac survey. This month, the same pollster showed Biden at 43 percent. In Wisconsin, Clinton's unfavorable rating stood at 52 percent in a Marquette survey. Marquette now shows Biden at 45 percent. In comparable surveys, Biden's net favorable rating has beaten Clinton's by 11 points in North Carolina, 13 in Wisconsin, 18 in Florida, 23 in Pennsylvania, and 27 in Georgia. Her average unfavorable rating across the five states was 56 percent. Biden's is 45 percent. That's the difference between winning and losing. 'In fact, these numbers understate the gap. The last voters to make up their minds are independents, and they're way more open to Biden than they were to Clinton. Among independents, in same-pollster comparisons, Biden's net favorable rating has exceeded Clinton's by shocking margins: 30 points in Wisconsin, 32 in Georgia, 38 in North Carolina, 44 in Pennsylvania, and 45 in Florida.\nGeneral election voters still perceive Biden as relatively moderate, and historically, more moderate presidential candidates generally do better in general elections. They generate less opposition when it comes to voter turnout and are perceived as less extreme by swing voters---though that advantage is declining. In fact, Trump benefited from this dynamic in 2016, when he was perceived as more moderate than most Republican candidates. 'Additionally, Biden's supposed lack of enthusiasm among small donors never really materialized. Despite struggling with online donations in the primary, Biden is now raising 1, 000 times as much online per day as he was last year. He's also outraising Trump, which suggests that maybe in fundraising, partisanship matters more than excitement around the nominee or even ideology. Likewise, voter turnout estimates remain very high. it is increasingly looking like Democractic primary voters might have been right about Biden's electability argument.\nTrump's relentless campaigning across the Rust Belt has masked the fact that many of his most powerful advisersincluding Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and his former top economic adviser Gary Cohnare closely aligned with the free-trade ethos of Wall Street. The five hundred thousand pre-coronavirus manufacturing jobs that the Trump Administration is touting, Robert E. Scott, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute noted, is the same relatively small number that were created during the last three years of Obama's term. 'Bernie Porn, the president of EPIC-MRA, one of Michigan's oldest pollsters, told me that a week before the 2016 election 'Clinton was leading among union members by only forty-six to thirty-eight per cent, with eight per cent for third-party candidates and thirteen per cent undecidedmost of which went to Trump.  In EPIC-MRA's most recent poll, Biden is leading among union members, seventy-one to twenty-three per cent. 'Dan Kaufman, New YorkerRegarding voter turnout, 'Texans have already cast more ballots in the 2020 election than they did in 2016. the state's urban and suburban counties have been the primary drivers of the turnout spike, with Harris County (home to Houston) mounting an especially impressive showing. Nearly 1. 4 million people have already cast ballots in Harris, setting a new record for the county. 'In 2018, a 27-year-old Colombian American immigrant named Lina Hidalgo narrowly defeated an 11-year Republican incumbent to become Harris's 'county judge,  its top elective position. In 2016, Harris spent roughly $4 million on administering its elections. Under Hidalgo's leadership, the county pumped that budget up to $31 million: Enough money to triple the number of early voting sites in the county, and keep some locations open 24 hours during the final days of early voting. no matter how the final vote tally shakes out, the existing data already offers Democrats one vital lesson: Obscure local elections can have enormous consequences.",

But while two of the statutes at issue require the government to prove that the defendant intended to break the law, the DOJ's repeated requests and demands to Trump---including a grand jury subpoena---will make it hard for him to argue that he did not realize that the records contained national security secrets that belonged to the federal government.\nFirst, while a president can declassify documents, there is a process for doing so; at the conclusion of the process, the special classified tabs and markings would be removed. Yet the tabs and markings are still on the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. Second, mere possession, much less declassification, of some documents, such as those marked ORCON, must first be approved by the originating agency. That doesn't seem to have been done either. Third, a presidentcertainly an ex-presidenthas no executive privilege to hold documents that properly belong to the National Archives.",

China's propaganda efforts to cast its response to the outbreak as a model for the rest of the world are falling somewhat flat, with scrutiny mounting over the credibility of China's reported numbers of infections and deaths. Its soft-power outreach to other parts of the world, particularly Europe, is starting to look more soft than powerful: A number of governments have had to throw out or recall Chinese-sent medical supplies because of concerns over defects. 'Meanwhile, the United States has become the epicenter of the pandemic, with the most reported cases in the world, and the grim likelihood that things are going to get considerably worse in the country's major cities. New reporting has shed even more light on the administration's dawdling and inattention in the early weeks of the outbreak, missteps that could cost thousands of lives.\nWhen the virus' dangerous potential became readily apparent in January, Trump should have immediately led an international effort to procure, allocate, and distribute needed medical equipment, to generate and share best practices on testing and isolation, and to advance the preparedness of lower income communities and countries that are likely to be particularly hard hit. Instead, it was not until March 16 -- months too late -- that Trump participated in a video conference to discuss the pandemic with the leaders of the G7. The following week, G7 foreign ministers could not muster the solidarity to issue a joint statement -- reportedly because Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted on inserting the term 'Wuhan virus' into the communique. 'The Chinese have been waiting for Europe with open arms at the same time that the United States is pushing Europeans away from the close partnership with America that has served both sides of the Atlantic so well since the 1940s. Trump's bumbling response to the pandemic is only expediting this trend. when this pandemic abates and Americans welcome the end of social distancing, they will nonetheless find the United States a very lonely country in the world.\n\nRight:\nIf Beijing had reported the true size of the outbreak there, public-health experts would've been sounding much louder alarms at the start---and the rest of the world would have begun making much greater preparations, sooner. Plenty of evidence suggests the US intel report is right. Also telling was how China refused to let a full World Health Organization team---or any experts from the US Centers for Disease Control---inspect the situation on the ground in the epidemic's early days. 'COVID-19 has claimed at least 42, 000 lives worldwide. A University of Southampton study estimates 95 percent of infections would have been avoided if China had acted just three weeks earlier---instead of silencing those who sought to save lives.\nWhat are the implications of China lying? Most basically, much of the current data about coronavirus is largely worthless because most of it comes from China's cooked books. That's changing by the hour as American and European doctors get to observe firsthand how the disease afflicts its victims; we'll have a more reliable data set soon for calculating the fatality rate, the infection rate, and so on. 'Another implication: We should never again trust, or fund, the World Health Organization once this crisis has passed. They've been China's loyal mouthpiece throughout the episode, treating the Chinese numbers as reliable. They're either willing propagandists or dupes.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) writes, 'In December, the WHO refused to act on or publicize Taiwan's warning that the new respiratory infection emerging in China could pass from human to human. In mid January, despite accumulating evidence of patients contracting what we now know as COVID-19 from other people, the organization repeated the CCP's lie that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. In January the WHO, at Beijing's behest, also blocked Taiwan from participating in critical meetings to coordinate responses to the coronavirus. 'The world's leading global health organization cannot be used as a tool of the CCP, and the U. S. ---the WHO's largest financial contributor, giving five times as much money as obligated---must take steps to ensure it doesn't. Once this pandemic is under control, WHO leadership should be held to account. That includes Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Maintaining current levels of U. S. contributions should depend on whether the WHO can reclaim its independence.\nThe United States---the country now most affected by COVID-19---must demand China make institutional changes in their domestic food safety policies to help eliminate the threat of pandemic. How many more animal-born viruses must we fall victim to before we demand that China and others stop the behavior that most often causes them? . . . 'We must form an international coalition to investigate China's food safety and health protocols, reporting and prevention. And, we must also call for the immediate closures of all 'wet markets' and enforce severe penalties for those who deal with the sale of wild animals that are known to spread illness.\nFinally, 'it's not too early to start thinking about how we can start distancing ourselves from China. First on that list should be protecting and rebuilding our own secure supply chain. We need to bring manufacturing back to the United States, especially for critical items our country needs. We should not rely on China for ingredients for our pharmaceuticals, and we should not depend on them to produce and supply antibiotics. 'Longer term, we should not look to China for components necessary for technology or count on them for resources that support our national defense and infrastructure. We need to prioritize economic independence as a permanent national security goal, not just a temporary solution to supply disruption.",
        "document": "Last week, ProPublica released a report tracking more than 10, 000 fake or hijacked Twitter accounts connected to the Chinese government that have been engaged in coronavirus-related propaganda worldwide. Twitter had frozen an additional 200, 000 accounts before they went active. 'Meanwhile Chinese tech giant Huawei has been focusing donations of equipment and support on countries where it is competing for 5G contracts. After the European Union's de facto foreign minister Josep Borrell suggested Beijing was playing the 'politics of generosity,  Huawei announced it would scale back sending masks to Europe, essentially proving Borrell's point. Countries around the world are suddenly waking up to the real dangers of depending on China for aid or information.\nAt the same time, 'U. S. -Chinese collaboration against infectious disease isn't a globalist fantasy. It has proved immensely effective in the past. And one of its greatest champions was George W. Bush. but Since Trump took office, both the CDC and the National Institutes of Health have reduced their staff in Beijing. The National Science Foundation has shut its office in the country entirely. 'This hard decoupling on public-health matters almost certainly undermined the U. S. government's initial understanding of COVID-19. To be sure, Beijing responded to the outbreak with a disastrous cover-up, followed by a harsh quarantine. It repeatedly and inexcusably delayed allowing a WHO delegation into Wuhan.

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nMr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are advancing the cynical argument that it was up to the House to gather evidence, and the Senate should not be tasked with filling gaps. But the gaps exist because of Mr. Trump's obstruction, a stonewall that the House probably could not have overcome without months of court proceedings that, during an election year, could have made impeachment a practical impossibility. Mr. Trump has said he will invoke executive privilege to curtail testimony by Mr. Bolton and others. That should only incentivize senators: If the president had nothing to fear from truthful testimony, he would not go to such lengths. 'Mr. Bolton has said he would testify if the Senate calls him, and he has a book forthcoming. Could it be that the Senate will refuse to hear a firsthand account that could soon be in the public domain?\nMr. Trump has never asserted any particularized reasons for preventing administration officials from cooperating with the impeachment investigation (beyond deeming it a 'sham' and a 'hoax' impeachment, which is not a legal argument but a political one). So, his claims are the epitome of 'generalized assertions'---which are not sufficient to trigger the application of executive privilege. 'Chief Justice Warren Burger, in United States v. Nixon, a major precedent decided in 1974 during the height of the Watergate investigation, found that the president does enjoy a constitutional privilege to protect confidences within the executive branch. At the same time, however, he emphatically rejected President Richard Nixon's claims then, like President Trump's claims now, that executive privilege is self-defined and potentially unlimited in scope. Chief Justice Burger explained that when the president's assertion of executive privilege 'is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. \nThe choice of House managers underscores the Democrats' effort to press Senate Republicans to treat this is a real trial, as mandated by the Constitution. The group includes six attorneys and one former police chief; all are people familiar with court proceedings and criminal activities. 'Despite Trump's determined effort to block the release of any of the documents requested by investigators, Americans were slapped with a new batch of material showing Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and another Trump supporter at work on the Ukraine scheme. As the Senate trial prepares to start, Americans of all parties should ponder, is this what they want from their president? Pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political rival; having US diplomats tracked and intimidated? Allowing oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to fund operations aimed at boosting his reelection chances?\nGiuliani's letter states that he was explicitly working in his capacity as Trump's personal attorney, undercutting the president's claim that the effort was in the country's interest because it was aimed at rooting out corruption. It also contradicts Trump's claim that Giuliani may have been working for other clients or for himself in Ukraine. The letter came one day after Giuliani told The New York Times that he planned to travel to Ukraine to find damaging information on Biden, which could help Trump's re-election campaign.\nTuesday's new evidence won't fundamentally change either side's approach in the upcoming trial. Parnas did not directly communicate with the president himself, making its relevance to his impeachment somewhat limited. What the revelations do underscore is how little Americans actually know about one of the worst political scandals in the nation's historyand the fierce urgency of shedding light on it. 'One need not be a conspiracy theorist to know that there's more to uncover here. Top aides like Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton haven't testified. The White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon haven't turned over any records about the plot to pressure Zelenskiy or hold up congressionally allocated military aid for Ukraine. Trump's impeachment trial may not hinge on this information. But it's still vital to uncover it so Americans can definitively answer the most important question about the Ukraine scandal: What happened?\n\nRight:\nOne of the two lead prosecutors would be kicked out of any normal court for repeated lies. Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the world for years in his nonstop campaign to smear President Trump. Back in March 2017, he insisted that he'd seen 'more than circumstantial evidence' that Trump had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election---a claim exposed as false by the Mueller report. Months later, he insisted that Rep. Duncan Nunes was flat-out wrong to say that the FBI's Russia investigation relied heavily on the absurd Steele Dossier to get warrants to surveil Carter Page; the recent inspector-general report shows that Nunes was right---and Schiff had to know it.\nPelosi should have appointed independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash instead of Schiff. Amash used to be a Republican, so he would at least have the appearance of moderation. Because he is now an independent, the accusation of deliberate partisanship simply would not apply. Amash is also in favor of impeaching Trump, but for constitutional reasons, not political ones. 'I might disagree with Amash's conclusions on impeachment, but I respect the way in which he reached those conclusions. He thought through the allegations, listened to the testimonies, read the evidence, and then made up his mind. Can Schiff say the same?\nHouse Democrats rushed through the investigation, forgoing salient witnesses and evidence, because of the political calendar. The charges are weak and the inquiry was needlessly short-circuited, so Democrats have continued investigating the premature allegations. Now they are publicly disclosing newly acquired evidence, with the promise of more to come. Transparently, their goal is to pressure the Senate not merely to conduct a trial but to complete the investigation that the House failed to complete. 'No trial court would allow itself to be whipsawed this way. A federal judge would tell prosecutors to go back to the grand jury, finish the investigation, and come back to the trial court when they have a case ready to be tried, not investigated. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans should hold the two pending articles in abeyance, or vote to dismiss them without prejudice to the House's revoting them when its impeachment inquiry is finally concluded.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) writes, 'The Senate's role is not to undertake a new inquiry, but rather to conduct a trial based on the articles of impeachment passed by the House and decide whether removing a president from office is warranted. It's also a historical precedent that the initial arguments in a Senate trial be limited to the testimony and evidence gathered by the House. 'During initial presentations, the Senate will only hear arguments from the record---the record the House built. After that initial phase, we can call in additional witnesses as needed. The argument that the Senate should be expanding investigations before initial arguments are even presented is a tacit acknowledgment on the part of some Democrats of what we all know to be true: the House rushed and failed to complete its duty thoroughly, making a mockery of the impeachment process.\nMrs. Pelosi said on the House floor Wednesday that her month delay allowed new 'evidence' to emerge. But if that's true, why did the House rush its votes before the holiday? In any case the new evidence she cites is merely more detail about what we already know. Mr. Trump exhibited poor judgment in unleashing Rudy Giuliani to ask Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. but he broke no law, and other Presidents have tried to use foreign policy to serve domestic political ends. Voters may conclude these are grounds for denying Mr. Trump re-election. But if they are enough to short-circuit a presidential term, then many more Presidents will be impeached. 'At this stage we don't see what good would be done by calling Senate witnesses. If Mr. Bolton is called, then Republicans may call Hunter or Joe Biden or both. This would be a circus, and it would pay too much homage to the flimsy House evidence and rigged process. The Senate may not even need to hear from the President's defense team. Let the House managers make their case. If a majority of Senators believe the evidence is as inadequate as we do, then repudiate this impeachment with votes to acquit on both articles.",
        "document": "Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are advancing the cynical argument that it was up to the House to gather evidence, and the Senate should not be tasked with filling gaps. But the gaps exist because of Mr. Trump's obstruction, a stonewall that the House probably could not have overcome without months of court proceedings that, during an election year, could have made impeachment a practical impossibility. Mr. Trump has said he will invoke executive privilege to curtail testimony by Mr. Bolton and others. That should only incentivize senators: If the president had nothing to fear from truthful testimony, he would not go to such lengths. 'Mr. Bolton has said he would testify if the Senate calls him, and he has a book forthcoming. Could it be that the Senate will refuse to hear a firsthand account that could soon be in the public domain?\nMr. Trump has never asserted any particularized reasons for preventing administration officials from cooperating with the impeachment investigation (beyond deeming it a 'sham' and a 'hoax' impeachment, which is not a legal argument but a political one). So, his claims are the epitome of 'generalized assertions'---which are not sufficient to trigger the application of executive privilege. 'Chief Justice Warren Burger, in United States v. Nixon, a major precedent decided in 1974 during the height of the Watergate investigation, found that the president does enjoy a constitutional privilege to protect confidences within the executive branch. At the same time, however, he emphatically rejected President Richard Nixon's claims then, like President Trump's claims now, that executive privilege is self-defined and potentially unlimited in scope. Chief Justice Burger explained that when the president's assertion of executive privilege 'is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. \nThe choice of House managers underscores the Democrats' effort to press Senate Republicans to treat this is a real trial, as mandated by the Constitution. The group includes six attorneys and one former police chief; all are people familiar with court proceedings and criminal activities. 'Despite Trump's determined effort to block the release of any of the documents requested by investigators, Americans were slapped with a new batch of material showing Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and another Trump supporter at work on the Ukraine scheme. As the Senate trial prepares to start, Americans of all parties should ponder, is this what they want from their president? Pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political rival; having US diplomats tracked and intimidated? Allowing oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to fund operations aimed at boosting his reelection chances?\nGiuliani's letter states that he was explicitly working in his capacity as Trump's personal attorney, undercutting the president's claim that the effort was in the country's interest because it was aimed at rooting out corruption. It also contradicts Trump's claim that Giuliani may have been working for other clients or for himself in Ukraine. The letter came one day after Giuliani told The New York Times that he planned to travel to Ukraine to find damaging information on Biden, which could help Trump's re-election campaign.\nTuesday's new evidence won't fundamentally change either side's approach in the upcoming trial. Parnas did not directly communicate with the president himself, making its relevance to his impeachment somewhat limited. What the revelations do underscore is how little Americans actually know about one of the worst political scandals in the nation's historyand the fierce urgency of shedding light on it. 'One need not be a conspiracy theorist to know that there's more to uncover here. Top aides like Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton haven't testified. The White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon haven't turned over any records about the plot to pressure Zelenskiy or hold up congressionally allocated military aid for Ukraine. Trump's impeachment trial may not hinge on this information. But it's still vital to uncover it so Americans can definitively answer the most important question about the Ukraine scandal: What happened?",
