Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the world for years in his nonstop campaign to smear President Trump. Back in March 2017, he insisted that he'd seen 'more than circumstantial evidence' that Trump had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election---a claim exposed as false by the Mueller report.

The charges are weak and the inquiry was needlessly short-circuited, so Democrats have continued investigating the premature allegations. Now they are publicly disclosing newly acquired evidence, with the promise of more to come. Transparently, their goal is to pressure the Senate not merely to conduct a trial but to complete the investigation that the House failed to complete. 'No trial court would allow itself to be whipsawed this way. A federal judge would tell prosecutors to go back to the grand jury, finish the investigation, and come back to the trial court when they have a case ready to be tried, not investigated. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans should hold the two pending articles in abeyance, or vote to dismiss them without prejudice to the House's revoting them when its impeachment inquiry is finally concluded.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) writes, 'The Senate's role is not to undertake a new inquiry, but rather to conduct a trial based on the articles of impeachment passed by the House and decide whether removing a president from office is warranted. It's also a historical precedent that the initial arguments in a Senate trial be limited to the testimony and evidence gathered by the House. 'During initial presentations, the Senate will only hear arguments from the record---the record the House built. After that initial phase, we can call in additional witnesses as needed. The argument that the Senate should be expanding investigations before initial arguments are even presented is a tacit acknowledgment on the part of some Democrats of what we all know to be true: the House rushed and failed to complete its duty thoroughly, making a mockery of the impeachment process.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said on the House floor Wednesday that her month delay allowed new 'evidence' to emerge. But if that's true, why did the House rush its votes before the holiday? In any case the new evidence she cites is merely more detail about what we already know. Mr. Trump exhibited poor judgment in unleashing Rudy Giuliani to ask Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. but he broke no law, and other Presidents have tried to use foreign policy to serve domestic political ends. Voters may conclude these are grounds for denying Mr. Trump re-election. But if they are enough to short-circuit a presidential term, then many more Presidents will be impeached. 'At this stage we don't see what good would be done by calling Senate witnesses. If Mr. Bolton is called, then Republicans may call Hunter or Joe Biden or both. This would be a circus, and it would pay too much homage to the flimsy House evidence and rigged process. The Senate may not even need to hear from the President's defense team. Let the House managers make their case. If a majority of Senators believe the evidence is as inadequate as we do, then repudiate this impeachment with votes to acquit on both articles.\n\nRight:\nMr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are advancing the cynical argument that it was up to the House to gather evidence, and the Senate should not be tasked with filling gaps. But the gaps exist because of Mr. Trump's obstruction, a stonewall that the House probably could not have overcome without months of court proceedings that, during an election year, could have made impeachment a practical impossibility. Mr. Trump has said he will invoke executive privilege to curtail testimony by Mr. Bolton and others. That should only incentivize senators: If the president had nothing to fear from truthful testimony, he would not go to such lengths. 'Mr. Bolton has said he would testify if the Senate calls him, and he has a book forthcoming. Could it be that the Senate will refuse to hear a firsthand account that could soon be in the public domain?\n\nMr. Trump has never asserted any particularized reasons for preventing administration officials from cooperating with the impeachment investigation (beyond deeming it a 'sham' and a 'hoax' impeachment, which is not a legal argument but a political one). So, his claims are the epitome of 'generalized assertions'---which are not sufficient to trigger the application of executive privilege. 'Chief Justice Warren Burger, in United States v. Nixon, a major precedent decided in 1974 during the height of the Watergate investigation, found that the president does enjoy a constitutional privilege to protect confidences within the executive branch. At the same time, however, he emphatically rejected President Richard Nixon's claims then, like President Trump's claims now, that executive privilege is self-defined and potentially unlimited in scope. Chief Justice Burger explained that when the president's assertion of executive privilege 'is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. \n\nThe choice of House managers underscores the Democrats' effort to press Senate Republicans to treat this is a real trial, as mandated by the Constitution. The group includes six attorneys and one former police chief; all are people familiar with court proceedings and criminal activities. 'Despite Trump's determined effort to block the release of any of the documents requested by investigators, Americans were slapped with a new batch of material showing Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and another Trump supporter at work on the Ukraine scheme. As the Senate trial prepares to start, Americans of all parties should ponder, is this what they want from their president? Pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political rival; having US diplomats tracked and intimidated? Allowing oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to fund operations aimed at boosting his reelection chances?\n\nGiuliani's letter states that he was explicitly working in his capacity as Trump's personal attorney, undercutting the president's claim that the effort was in the country's interest because it was aimed at rooting out corruption. It also contradicts Trump's claim that Giuliani may have been working for other clients or for himself in Ukraine. The letter came one day after Giuliani told The New York Times that he planned to travel to Ukraine to find damaging information on Biden, which could help Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nTuesday's new evidence won't fundamentally change either side's approach in the upcoming trial. Parnas did not directly communicate with the president himself, making its relevance to his impeachment somewhat limited. What the revelations do underscore is how little Americans actually know about one of the worst political scandals in the nation's historyand the fierce urgency of shedding light on it. 'One need not be a conspiracy theorist to know that there's more to uncover here. Top aides like Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton haven't testified. The White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon haven't turned over any records about the plot to pressure Zelenskiy or hold up congressionally allocated military aid for Ukraine. Trump's impeachment trial may not hinge on this information. But it's still vital to uncover it so Americans can definitively answer the most important question about the Ukraine scandal: What happened?",

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nPros laughed at his use of charts and talk of NAFTA's 'giant sucking sound' taking jobs to Mexico, but he won the very voters who'd later be the core Trump constituency. It's easy to see why: During the '92 campaign, he groused: 'Our president blames Congress, Congress blames the president, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody steps up to the plate and accepts responsibility for anything.  Ross Perot the outsider still has a point. Rest in peace.\n\nWhen you look closely at Perot's campaigns, you see his influence everywhere ever since. His populist attitude against Washington informed the Gingrich-led Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. His fondness for plain-spoken fiscal rectitude popped up again in Al Gore's Social Security 'lock box' and later in the Tea Party. And of course, Perot now looks like the Morning Star of Trumpism. Like Perot, President Trump is also a billionaire populist and a trade protectionist. Trump appeals to the same secular, nationalist voters that were Perot's base. But Trump also appealed to and made pacts with all the factions of the Republican party. 'Michael Brendan Dougherty, National Review\n\nPerot's allergy to social conservatives was one of the things that would doom his populism. Trump, like Perot, campaigned as something of a moderate on social issues---but he did so without excluding social conservatives, and since becoming president he has served his coalition allies better than many a professed true-believer conservative Republican ever did. Trump also realized, as Perot should have recognized a quarter-century earlier, that third-party politics was a waste of time, when the same resources could be used to take over the GOP from within.\n\nFrom the perspective of 2019, H. Ross Perot looks like a key precursor to Trump: the billionaire political outsider who popped up on Larry King Live, opposed free trade deals, and who spoke bluntly and simply and promised to just roll up his sleeves and look under the hood. But there were some key differences. Perot worried about the deficit---'the crazy aunt in the basement' and about the debt---back when it was a 'mere' $5 trillion. He supported means-testing Social Security. His policy interests were not wide but he knew enough about them to give lectures with charts. Perot was feisty but rarely obnoxious. 'Jim Geraghty, National Review\n\nWhat stood out for me about Perot was his raging moderation. Unlike most angry candidates running a populist campaign, Perot was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, and basically a centrist---more so, anyway than his two opponents (which is why Team Bush was wrong, I think, to claim that Perot cost Bush the election; studies have shown that Perot took about as many votes away from Clinton as he did from Bush). Trump's political genius, or one aspect of it, was his realization that he could capture the Republican presidential nomination and, eventually, the Republican Party. I wonder how Perot would have fared if he had tried to do the same. 'Paul Mirengoff, Power Line Blog\n\nAfter Republicans lost in 2012, failing to retake the White House and actually losing Senate seats despite a sagging Obama-era economy, two prominent analyses were proposed. One---the Republican National Committee's 'autopsy'---said the GOP's problem was embracing social issues too much and liberal immigration too little. The other analysis---the 'Missing White Voter' thesis---was grounded in actual data. It said the problem was that the GOP of the Bush family and Mitt Romney had turned off working-class whites to the point that they disengaged. Put another way, the GOP establishment in 2012 said the party could win by becoming more like George H. W. Bush; the deeper analysis said it could win if it became more like Ross Perot. 'Ross Perot didn't 'give us Trump.  But he gave us an insight into what America was really like. It just took 20 years for someone to put that insight to use.\n\nRight:\nBoth men convinced large numbers of Americans that it was better to have a successful business executive to solve the nation's problems. Their pitch was that experience in the law, statecraft, diplomacy and government were irrelevant to seeking the highest office in the land---indeed such qualifications were corrupting. H. Ross Perot pioneered the insurgent trail that Trump rode to victory.\n\nHis television platform was Larry King Live, not The Apprentice, and his persona was genial and folksy, not blustery and dark. But more than a quarter century ago, Ross Perot revealed a truth about the American electorate that Donald Trump would exploit: There is a big chunk of voters who feel disaffected, harmed by free trade, threatened by demographic change, and attracted to an eccentric outsider who promises to upend the status quo.\n\nPerot, like Donald Trump, attracted a lot of disaffected white non-college graduates. A lot of these types of voters would later jump to the Republican Party and power Trump's presidential victory in 2016. But to call Perot the first Trump probably doesn't do either man enough justice. Trump's brand of populism is far angrier than Perot's ever was. And Perot dealt with slights differently than Trump. When he was called 'crazy,  Perot adopted the song 'Crazy' as his 'campaign song,  even dancing to it. In this way and many others, Perot was one of a kind.\n\nNothing remotely like to the accusations of personal corruption that surround Trump ever arose in connection with the fastidious Perot, a famed/infamous moral scold.

'She taped it. And it was not only taped, it was taped a long time ago, because she had the wrong deaths. She didn't even mention the vice presidential candidate. Think of what Trump is saying here: Michelle Obama really screwed up her speech because she said 150, 000 Americans had died from coronavirus when, in fact, that number is now well over 170, 000. 'What Trump's comment reinforces is his belief that he bears no responsibility -- and is not blamed by the public -- for the country's ongoing struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Reminding people that in the relatively short period of time between when Michelle Obama taped her convention speech and when it ran on Monday night, an additional 20, 000 Americans have died from Covid-19 is a disastrous self-own by Trump.\n\nRegarding the party's platform, 'There's no endorsement of Medicare-for-all, no call to defund the police, no call to abolish ICE, no call to ban fracking, no support for legalizing marijuana nationwide, and no backing of free college for all. But it's hard to characterize this platform as moderate. On health care, the platform calls for free Covid-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines for all, for making a generous public option for health insurance available to all Americans, and for empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. 'On the climate crisis, the platform calls for major new clean energy spending, and for eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 (an earlier target than Democrats previously proposed). It proposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, significantly increasing the child tax credit, and aggressively increasing the supply of housing (including affordable housing). Overall, the platform isn't a radical break from Democrats' past---this is Joe Biden we're talking about---but it contains a very wide-ranging suite of progressive proposals.\n\nProgressives want to hear that conservative policy ideas have failed on a practical level and are about to be swept aside in favor of an entirely new agenda. Somewhat ironically, it's former president and centrist extraordinaire Bill Clinton who delivered a speech that was closest to that spirit on Tuesday---talking about 'good jobs in green energy and conservation to combat climate change' and creating 'a living wage, and access to affordable higher education and health care, including prescription drugs, child care, a secure retirement, and paid family and medical leave. 'Meanwhile Jill Biden's speech reminded us that we've been suffering through months of a void of emotional leadership, living in a country whose head of state doesn't seem to realize or care that this is a difficult situation. The moment of connection with a person who grasps exactly how bad things are was, ironically, the single most hopeful moment of American politics in months.\n\nThe convention lineup seems tailored to appeal to older Americans and longtime voters. But sidelining figures who appeal to the young is a missed opportunity to build Democratic Party loyalty. Democrats made the right choice to highlight Barack Obama, then a 43-year-old Senate candidate, to deliver the 2004 keynote address, which propelled him to the presidency four years later. Instead of unfurling a vision that inspires millions of young people, the party's next Obama might be spending convention week tweeting her impressions from the sidelines.\n\nRight:\nThe Democratic Convention's first night no doubt had the loyalists tune in and leave the box on, but the traditional conventions draw their miserable ratings for the funny hats the Texas delegates wear, for the crazies outside the hall and for the panel discussions broadcasting from bars and coffee shops. Rarely do the networks actually cover the speeches, and even when they do, they cut away frequently to other things. It's the energy of the real conventions that made them at all watchable. This was, in a word, unwatchable. 'Republicans should learn from the Democrats' fiasco and switch it up quickly for their convention next week. The best choice is 20 hours of President Trump interviews with 20 different interlocutors. He's still the best interview in America. Trump knows TV. That's why he won the 2016 debates---all of them. His inner programmer knows he doesn't need to share the stage. Sure, put the candidates in key Senate races in prime time for 15 minutes, but just because the Democrats jumped off a ratings cliff doesn't mean the GOP has to follow them.\n\nListening to Governor Cuomo, one would think that he had not in fact presided over the nation's, and perhaps the world's, most disastrous Covid-19 response. New York State has seen about 34, 000 Covid-related deaths, out of a national total of 170, 000, which means that New Yorkers have died at a rate close to four times what would be expected based on their proportion of the U. S. population. 'Moreover, Cuomo bears considerable responsibility for at least 6, 700 deaths of people in care facilities, and possibly many thousands more, because of his health commissioner's mandate in March that nursing homes admit Covid patients after being discharged from the hospital. Last night, Cuomo explained what he saw as a key lesson of the pandemic: 'How vulnerable we are when we are divided and how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent.  He was referring to leadership in Washington, but the governor could just as easily have been talking about his own governance.\n\nThe first night of the Democratic National Convention focused heavily on the coronavirus and the effects it has had on people across the country, but there was one massive omission: China. The CCP still has not produced truthful data on how many people the virus killed in China, and the propaganda it fed the world through the World Health Organization led to nations putting their guard down on the virus. China sold faulty medical equipment to countries in need and silenced whistleblowers, all while trying to blame the U. S. military for causing the outbreak. You wouldn't know this from watching the Democratic National Convention, though. 'In its singular focus on winning in November, the Democratic Party is going to let China get away with causing a global pandemic. The party has thus far managed more anger for those calling it the 'Wuhan virus' than for the Chinese government letting it spread from Wuhan to America. China caused this, and China, at least rhetorically, should pay the price.\n\nThe one deficiency of Tuesday's convention, which is no small deal, was the total lack of discussion on policy. Bill Clinton strongly criticized Trump for his handling of the pandemic, but offered little indication of how Biden would have handled it differently if president. Would Biden have tried to enact a nationwide lockdown? Would he have demanded Congress spend more money on relief? . The Democrats have calcified their pitch against Trump. They have made a case for Biden's decency, but they have yet to make a compelling case that Biden can make a real difference on the coronavirus, the economy, or any of the numerous other issues on deck.\n\nAfter all the hype, the Democratic Party's Me Too-era reckoning over Bill Clinton ended with the former president getting a speaking slot at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The move is evidence Clinton's power in the party hasn't diminished to the degree many expected, which is itself evidence that the Democratic establishment's bluster about Me Too was more about political expediency than women. Al Franken should be in revolt.",

New York State has seen about 34, 000 Covid-related deaths, out of a national total of 170, 000, which means that New Yorkers have died at a rate close to four times what would be expected based on their proportion of the U. S. population. 'Moreover, Cuomo bears considerable responsibility for at least 6, 700 deaths of people in care facilities, and possibly many thousands more, because of his health commissioner's mandate in March that nursing homes admit Covid patients after being discharged from the hospital. Last night, Cuomo explained what he saw as a key lesson of the pandemic: 'How vulnerable we are when we are divided and how many lives can be lost when our government is incompetent.  He was referring to leadership in Washington, but the governor could just as easily have been talking about his own governance.\n\nThe first night of the Democratic National Convention focused heavily on the coronavirus and the effects it has had on people across the country, but there was one massive omission: China. The CCP still has not produced truthful data on how many people the virus killed in China, and the propaganda it fed the world through the World Health Organization led to nations putting their guard down on the virus. China sold faulty medical equipment to countries in need and silenced whistleblowers, all while trying to blame the U. S. military for causing the outbreak. You wouldn't know this from watching the Democratic National Convention, though. 'In its singular focus on winning in November, the Democratic Party is going to let China get away with causing a global pandemic. The party has thus far managed more anger for those calling it the 'Wuhan virus' than for the Chinese government letting it spread from Wuhan to America. China caused this, and China, at least rhetorically, should pay the price.\n\nThe one deficiency of Tuesday's convention, which is no small deal, was the total lack of discussion on policy. Bill Clinton strongly criticized Trump for his handling of the pandemic, but offered little indication of how Biden would have handled it differently if president. Would Biden have tried to enact a nationwide lockdown? Would he have demanded Congress spend more money on relief? . The Democrats have calcified their pitch against Trump. They have made a case for Biden's decency, but they have yet to make a compelling case that Biden can make a real difference on the coronavirus, the economy, or any of the numerous other issues on deck.\n\nAfter all the hype, the Democratic Party's Me Too-era reckoning over Bill Clinton ended with the former president getting a speaking slot at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The move is evidence Clinton's power in the party hasn't diminished to the degree many expected, which is itself evidence that the Democratic establishment's bluster about Me Too was more about political expediency than women. Al Franken should be in revolt.\n\nRight:\nMichelle Obama laid out a detailed, searing indictment of President Trump---and somehow managed to speak his name just once. about midway through the 18-minute talk---by far the longest of the night---she called him out. 'Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He is clearly in over his head,  she said. 'It is what it is.  Surely not by coincidence, 'it is what it is' are the very words Trump used in a recent interview to dismiss nearly 170, 000 U. S. deaths from the coronavirus pandemic he so badly mishandled. For someone who says she hates politics, Michelle Obama is a political powerhouse.\n\nThe President was asked about the former first lady's speech at the Democratic National Convention. 'She taped it. And it was not only taped, it was taped a long time ago, because she had the wrong deaths. She didn't even mention the vice presidential candidate. Think of what Trump is saying here: Michelle Obama really screwed up her speech because she said 150, 000 Americans had died from coronavirus when, in fact, that number is now well over 170, 000. 'What Trump's comment reinforces is his belief that he bears no responsibility -- and is not blamed by the public -- for the country's ongoing struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Reminding people that in the relatively short period of time between when Michelle Obama taped her convention speech and when it ran on Monday night, an additional 20, 000 Americans have died from Covid-19 is a disastrous self-own by Trump.\n\nRegarding the party's platform, 'There's no endorsement of Medicare-for-all, no call to defund the police, no call to abolish ICE, no call to ban fracking, no support for legalizing marijuana nationwide, and no backing of free college for all. But it's hard to characterize this platform as moderate. On health care, the platform calls for free Covid-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines for all, for making a generous public option for health insurance available to all Americans, and for empowering Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. 'On the climate crisis, the platform calls for major new clean energy spending, and for eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 (an earlier target than Democrats previously proposed). It proposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, significantly increasing the child tax credit, and aggressively increasing the supply of housing (including affordable housing). Overall, the platform isn't a radical break from Democrats' past---this is Joe Biden we're talking about---but it contains a very wide-ranging suite of progressive proposals.\n\nProgressives want to hear that conservative policy ideas have failed on a practical level and are about to be swept aside in favor of an entirely new agenda. Somewhat ironically, it's former president and centrist extraordinaire Bill Clinton who delivered a speech that was closest to that spirit on Tuesday---talking about 'good jobs in green energy and conservation to combat climate change' and creating 'a living wage, and access to affordable higher education and health care, including prescription drugs, child care, a secure retirement, and paid family and medical leave. 'Meanwhile Jill Biden's speech reminded us that we've been suffering through months of a void of emotional leadership, living in a country whose head of state doesn't seem to realize or care that this is a difficult situation. The moment of connection with a person who grasps exactly how bad things are was, ironically, the single most hopeful moment of American politics in months.\n\nThe convention lineup seems tailored to appeal to older Americans and longtime voters. But sidelining figures who appeal to the young is a missed opportunity to build Democratic Party loyalty. Democrats made the right choice to highlight Barack Obama, then a 43-year-old Senate candidate, to deliver the 2004 keynote address, which propelled him to the presidency four years later.

Far from being a counterexample to the theory that moderation pays off, Trump's election is, if anything, a testament to its power.

Another example was 'open borders.  Trump and the Republicans often speak about how the Democrats are for 'open borders,  or allowing anyone to enter the country, regardless of need for asylum or ability to contribute to society.

Twice as many Democrats are over 65 than are under 30. More than half of Democrats who voted in 2018 identify themselves as moderate or conservative. 'Very liberal' Americans account for only 19 percent of the party's voters. There is absolutely no need for Biden to be afraid of the Left.

Ted Budd (R-NC) writes, 'A few weeks ago, local officials in Greenville, Miss. , singled out Temple Baptist Church for hosting drive-in religious services despite the state declaring churches as essential. It didn't matter that churchgoers had their windows rolled up while listening to the sermon broadcast over the FM radio. Police officers began knocking on car windows demanding identification and issuing $500 citations. Cases of overreach like this have led Attorney General William Barr to release a memo ordering federal prosecutors across the country to take legal action against state and local directives that infringe upon individual liberties. 'This is not to say that we should threaten states and local governments' ability to enact the policies they see fit during this pandemic. As long as actions taken do not infringe on the civil liberties of American citizens, those governments should be free to govern how they wish. However, history has repeatedly shown us that during times of fear, it's common to see individuals in positions of power cross inappropriate and unconstitutional lines. It is our job to conduct the appropriate oversight and ensure that responses to this pandemic are measured and based on both medical expertise and the law.\n\nThe Virginia church claims 'unequal treatment, and it submits photographs to make the point. One of them is a recent picture of Mr. Northam at a coronavirus press briefing. At least 21 people are visible in the room. Businesses deemed essential, meanwhile, attract hundreds. The church shows a photo of a Walmart parking lot, where its lawyers counted 268 cars. Virginia's state-run liquor stores are open and reportedly had their best March on record. 'When pressed last month about whether New Jersey's lockdown comported with the U. S. Constitution, Governor Phil Murphy said the question was above his pay grade: 'I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.

And the researchers I spoke to last week were worried about exactly the opposite dynamic: At this point, many Americans are just taking ivermectin instead of enrolling in trials for potential COVID treatments.\n\nRight:\nSnarking that Joe Rogan is taking a 'horse dewormer' for his coronavirus infection may well be (and probably is) inaccurate. In its haste to goof on Rogan for having flirted with anti-vaxxism in the past, the press is being irresponsible. And they should be called on it. But the bigger story is that seemingly many thousands of Americans are hunting around for a drug which at least 14 different studies have shown doesn't work on COVID. 'Some meaningful number of our fellow citizens are either so allergic to medical consensus or so dug in on their antipathy to the vaccines that they're willing to dose themselves with an unproven drug in the expectation that they'll eventually own the smarmy pro-vax eggheads when ivermectin ends up curing their COVID. It's true that taking normal doses of the drug won't harm a person, but that's not the point. What'll harm them is encouraging or enabling their foolish decision to rely on an unproven prophylactic/treatment in lieu of getting the vaccine.\nWe have three approved vaccines in use in the US, plus we have monoclonal antibody treatments available---which Rogan is also employing to deal with his acute infection. One could understand individuals and a few doctors experimenting with treatments when we had no tested and effective treatments available to deal with an explosive pandemic. That's no longer the case, and we should be emphasizing the use of what we know works rather than take flyers on medicines that haven't been demonstrated effective against any viruses, let alone COVID-19 in particular. 'In other words---get vaccinated. If you get a breakthrough infection anyway, get monoclonal antibody treatment as soon as possible. Stick to what we already know is effective. That's the responsible approach to personal health in this pandemic. 'Ed Morrissey, Hot AirOthers argue, 'we do not know whether ivermectin is an effective treatment against COVID-19. Because it's not an anti-viral treatment, it's very likely that it's not effective at all. But there is also no evidence that ivermectin would harm coronavirus patients if it is prescribed in the correct dosage. So why shouldn't patients be able to request the drug for treatment if they want?\nWe do know that ivermectin can cause your body to produce a strong immune response even though it's for parasites like worms and the like. But A great many people in the medical community, epidemiologists, virologists, and others believe that ivermectin itself is not actually helping. That to the extent people feel benefited from it, they're getting either the placebo effect or their body was on the verge of turning the corner anyway because they had a mild case. 'So now let's take the next step. Is it the placebo effect? Maybe. Is it people who are going to turn the corner anyway? Maybe. Is it ivermectin actually did something? Maybe. Studies are still outstanding. What we do know is there are people and doctors who do believe that their patients saw the benefit. 'Why are public health officials in the media dismissing ivermectin and ridiculing people who take it? Not the horse dosage, but the doctors who say, hey, there are a lot of people out there who think this works. You've got a case of COVID. Let's get this in your system and see if it helps. Why are we ridiculing those people when they're trying to help their patients who may not be vaccinated? . If ivermectin has a shot at helping people turn the corner, why not give it to them?",

Because it's not an anti-viral treatment, it's very likely that it's not effective at all. But there is also no evidence that ivermectin would harm coronavirus patients if it is prescribed in the correct dosage. So why shouldn't patients be able to request the drug for treatment if they want?\nWe do know that ivermectin can cause your body to produce a strong immune response even though it's for parasites like worms and the like. But A great many people in the medical community, epidemiologists, virologists, and others believe that ivermectin itself is not actually helping. That to the extent people feel benefited from it, they're getting either the placebo effect or their body was on the verge of turning the corner anyway because they had a mild case. 'So now let's take the next step. Is it the placebo effect? Maybe. Is it people who are going to turn the corner anyway? Maybe. Is it ivermectin actually did something? Maybe.

'Why are public health officials in the media dismissing ivermectin and ridiculing people who take it? Not the horse dosage, but the doctors who say, hey, there are a lot of people out there who think this works. You've got a case of COVID. Let's get this in your system and see if it helps. Why are we ridiculing those people when they're trying to help their patients who may not be vaccinated? . If ivermectin has a shot at helping people turn the corner, why not give it to them?\n\nRight:\nDespite its surging popularity, there's no good evidence that ivermectin is effective against the coronavirus. The largest and most reputable clinical trial to date found the drug offered no clinical benefit whatsoever, and much of what's been sold as promising evidence to the contrary has been debunked. Meanwhile, increasing reports of emergency room visits, poison control calls, and significant side effects associated with off-label ivermectin uselargely among patients unwilling to get vaccinated against Covid-19, even as hospitalizations and deaths climbhave become downright alarming.\nThe pro-ivermectin crowd would have you believe that the science on ivermectin is being 'suppressed.  It is not. Some of the largest scale scientific efforts ever have involved the study of ivermectin in Covid-19. Another claim is that the pharmaceutical industry does not want to lose potential profits to a relatively cheap, older drug. This claim conveniently ignores the fact that one of the only drugs with good evidence for use in Covid-19 is dexamethasone, a cheap, old drug that has been implemented worldwide during this pandemic. 'Groups of contrarian physicians have emerged to promote 'cures' without adding any evidence, and despite names like 'America's Front Line Doctors' and 'Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance,  their members often do not work clinically---meaning they do not actually have credentials to practice medicine in any hospital settings---and do not treat Covid-19 patients.\nThese fringe groups of contrarian physicians are small and have damning track records. America's Front Line Doctors is reported to be involved in fraudulent business practices involving charging people and failing to deliver on prescriptions and consultations. And the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology dropped a study by the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance after it was discovered that the authors made unsubstantiated claims. 'So why are these groups trusted? They have unique credibility with hard-core right-wingers and anti-vaxxers. The founder of America's Front Line Doctors entered the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6. And the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance has gotten support from anti-vaccination activists online and in the podcast world. This matters because it suggests that vulgar hostility to science isn't the only culprit in communities resistant to the vaccines. 'There's a desire, even among those on the fringe of mainstream beliefs about medicine, for technical information, insider knowledge and some kind of expertise. the desire to opt out of mainstream public health norms doesn't mean that everyone opposed to the vaccines fails to appreciate the dangers of Covid-19. It means that there's a search for an alternative solution to the government-backed vaccines which requires turning to sources who have perceived ideological credibility. This has substantial implications for how we go about trying to persuade those resisting the vaccines.\nEarlier this week, Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky. ), who is an ophthalmologist, argued that 'hatred for Trump' was hindering ivermectin research. Actually, Sen. Paul is who's hindering ivermectin research: He voted against the March stimulus bill that included funding for the NIH ACTIV-6 trial, which is studying ivermectin. And the researchers I spoke to last week were worried about exactly the opposite dynamic: At this point, many Americans are just taking ivermectin instead of enrolling in trials for potential COVID treatments.",

Rather, it's the non-monetary price that the Trump administration is demanding to secure aid for unemployed people and for state workers who risk losing their jobs because state governments are broke. That price is the indemnification of employers from lawsuits brought by workers who contract Covid-19 on the job. 'In the few instances where OSHA has leveled fines, the amounts have been laughably scant. OSHA recently levied a $15, 615 fine against the JBS beef factory in Greely, Colorado, where 290 workers were infected with Covid-19 and six died. Fifteen grand was not even enough. to cover the cost of the funeral for Saul Sanchez, one of the six who perished. Sanchez worked at the JBS plant for more than 30 years. That sums up the state of play for ordinary working Americans before McConnell extends this liability shield and screws them further. Saving unemployment benefits isn't worth it if we have to sell out frontline workers.\nThere's something fundamentally incredible about Trump's suggestion that mean old Nancy Pelosi won't accept a deal on any terms. If he wants one, all he's got to do is tell Mnuchin to get as much as he can in last-minute concessions and then just agree to the damn thing.

Recessions are always uneven, but this appears on track to be even more so.\nSNAP is a proven way to lift families out of poverty, reduce food insecurity and boost the economy.

She can also try to counterprogram Trump by insisting that Senate Republicans are the main obstacle, as they're the only player opposed to a big package, but that's hard for voters to grasp when the leader of the GOP is broadcasting his willingness to go even higher than Democrats will. 'She's also getting pressure from the left to bite the bullet and make a deal with Trump. Progressives like Ro Khanna are less concerned with electoral politics than with the fact that fiscal relief really is needed urgently for working-class people who can't find a job in the pandemic and also can't make rent next month. It is. unusual to find lefties begging the Democratic establishment to compromise with the right on grounds that half a loaf is better than none, but that's where we are right now.",
        "document": "The really thorny aspect of the continuing negotiations between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has nothing to do with federal spending at all. Rather, it's the non-monetary price that the Trump administration is demanding to secure aid for unemployed people and for state workers who risk losing their jobs because state governments are broke. That price is the indemnification of employers from lawsuits brought by workers who contract Covid-19 on the job. 'In the few instances where OSHA has leveled fines, the amounts have been laughably scant. OSHA recently levied a $15, 615 fine against the JBS beef factory in Greely, Colorado, where 290 workers were infected with Covid-19 and six died. Fifteen grand was not even enough. to cover the cost of the funeral for Saul Sanchez, one of the six who perished. Sanchez worked at the JBS plant for more than 30 years. That sums up the state of play for ordinary working Americans before McConnell extends this liability shield and screws them further. Saving unemployment benefits isn't worth it if we have to sell out frontline workers.\nThere's something fundamentally incredible about Trump's suggestion that mean old Nancy Pelosi won't accept a deal on any terms. If he wants one, all he's got to do is tell Mnuchin to get as much as he can in last-minute concessions and then just agree to the damn thing. The two sides are already within hailing distance on the overall price tag, so splitting the difference on particulars should not be impossible. If Trump is serious about an agreement, his public and private negotiating stances need to come together immediately.\nEven if Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin come to terms, the Senate would still have to go along. And for now, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ), deferring to the misguided concerns about spending and deficits of some GOP senators, says no. Instead, he plans a floor vote on a much smaller $500 billion 'targeted' package that would, among other things, aid small businesses and airlines but omit both the direct payments to households and state and local aid that a Pelosi-Mnuchin bill would include. 'Perhaps Mr. McConnell is playing bad cop---trying to pressure Ms. Pelosi into striking a deal on terms more favorable to the GOP. Certainly that is the most hopeful interpretation of a position that otherwise makes little policy sense and leaves him and his caucus in deserved political isolation. The American people continue to suffer the economic impact of the coronavirus, with the brunt of it being borne by low-income people and people of color. All sides involved in the negotiations over much-needed new funds should act with the urgency this situation requires.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 7. 9 percent in September, but if you dig into the numbers, you see an uneven picture. Women are dropping out of the workforce at a staggering rate, as school closures and the burden of childcare often falls on women. For white workers, the unemployment rate is 7 percent, but for Black workers, it is 12. 1 percent, and for Hispanic workers, 10. 3 percent. Recessions are always uneven, but this appears on track to be even more so.\nSNAP is a proven way to lift families out of poverty, reduce food insecurity and boost the economy. And unlike unemployment benefits, which have been plagued by delays, new SNAP benefits have been quickly distributed. The problem is that benefits are not sufficient. The monthly per person benefit is $136, which averages to about $1. 40 per meal. An analysis from a few years ago indicated that the SNAP benefit does not cover the cost of a meal in 99 percent of U. S. continental counties and Washington, D. C. , and food prices have risen considerably since the start of the pandemic. 'To meet unmet needs, the House HEROES bills included a temporary 15 percent increase in the SNAP benefit, equivalent to about $100 for a family of four each month. Such a change would significantly strengthen the federal food safety net. A similar SNAP expansion during the Great Recession helped to reduce food insecurity among low-income households, especially those with children. We have the policy tools to strengthen the safety net now and for the future. We just need the political will to make it happen.",

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nMr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are advancing the cynical argument that it was up to the House to gather evidence, and the Senate should not be tasked with filling gaps. But the gaps exist because of Mr. Trump's obstruction, a stonewall that the House probably could not have overcome without months of court proceedings that, during an election year, could have made impeachment a practical impossibility. Mr. Trump has said he will invoke executive privilege to curtail testimony by Mr. Bolton and others. That should only incentivize senators: If the president had nothing to fear from truthful testimony, he would not go to such lengths. 'Mr. Bolton has said he would testify if the Senate calls him, and he has a book forthcoming. Could it be that the Senate will refuse to hear a firsthand account that could soon be in the public domain?\nMr. Trump has never asserted any particularized reasons for preventing administration officials from cooperating with the impeachment investigation (beyond deeming it a 'sham' and a 'hoax' impeachment, which is not a legal argument but a political one). So, his claims are the epitome of 'generalized assertions'---which are not sufficient to trigger the application of executive privilege. 'Chief Justice Warren Burger, in United States v. Nixon, a major precedent decided in 1974 during the height of the Watergate investigation, found that the president does enjoy a constitutional privilege to protect confidences within the executive branch. At the same time, however, he emphatically rejected President Richard Nixon's claims then, like President Trump's claims now, that executive privilege is self-defined and potentially unlimited in scope. Chief Justice Burger explained that when the president's assertion of executive privilege 'is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. \nThe choice of House managers underscores the Democrats' effort to press Senate Republicans to treat this is a real trial, as mandated by the Constitution. The group includes six attorneys and one former police chief; all are people familiar with court proceedings and criminal activities. 'Despite Trump's determined effort to block the release of any of the documents requested by investigators, Americans were slapped with a new batch of material showing Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and another Trump supporter at work on the Ukraine scheme. As the Senate trial prepares to start, Americans of all parties should ponder, is this what they want from their president? Pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political rival; having US diplomats tracked and intimidated? Allowing oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to fund operations aimed at boosting his reelection chances?\nGiuliani's letter states that he was explicitly working in his capacity as Trump's personal attorney, undercutting the president's claim that the effort was in the country's interest because it was aimed at rooting out corruption. It also contradicts Trump's claim that Giuliani may have been working for other clients or for himself in Ukraine. The letter came one day after Giuliani told The New York Times that he planned to travel to Ukraine to find damaging information on Biden, which could help Trump's re-election campaign.\nTuesday's new evidence won't fundamentally change either side's approach in the upcoming trial. Parnas did not directly communicate with the president himself, making its relevance to his impeachment somewhat limited. What the revelations do underscore is how little Americans actually know about one of the worst political scandals in the nation's historyand the fierce urgency of shedding light on it. 'One need not be a conspiracy theorist to know that there's more to uncover here. Top aides like Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton haven't testified. The White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon haven't turned over any records about the plot to pressure Zelenskiy or hold up congressionally allocated military aid for Ukraine. Trump's impeachment trial may not hinge on this information. But it's still vital to uncover it so Americans can definitively answer the most important question about the Ukraine scandal: What happened?\n\nRight:\nOne of the two lead prosecutors would be kicked out of any normal court for repeated lies. Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the world for years in his nonstop campaign to smear President Trump. Back in March 2017, he insisted that he'd seen 'more than circumstantial evidence' that Trump had colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election---a claim exposed as false by the Mueller report. Months later, he insisted that Rep. Duncan Nunes was flat-out wrong to say that the FBI's Russia investigation relied heavily on the absurd Steele Dossier to get warrants to surveil Carter Page; the recent inspector-general report shows that Nunes was right---and Schiff had to know it.\nPelosi should have appointed independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash instead of Schiff. Amash used to be a Republican, so he would at least have the appearance of moderation. Because he is now an independent, the accusation of deliberate partisanship simply would not apply. Amash is also in favor of impeaching Trump, but for constitutional reasons, not political ones. 'I might disagree with Amash's conclusions on impeachment, but I respect the way in which he reached those conclusions. He thought through the allegations, listened to the testimonies, read the evidence, and then made up his mind. Can Schiff say the same?\nHouse Democrats rushed through the investigation, forgoing salient witnesses and evidence, because of the political calendar. The charges are weak and the inquiry was needlessly short-circuited, so Democrats have continued investigating the premature allegations. Now they are publicly disclosing newly acquired evidence, with the promise of more to come. Transparently, their goal is to pressure the Senate not merely to conduct a trial but to complete the investigation that the House failed to complete. 'No trial court would allow itself to be whipsawed this way. A federal judge would tell prosecutors to go back to the grand jury, finish the investigation, and come back to the trial court when they have a case ready to be tried, not investigated. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans should hold the two pending articles in abeyance, or vote to dismiss them without prejudice to the House's revoting them when its impeachment inquiry is finally concluded.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) writes, 'The Senate's role is not to undertake a new inquiry, but rather to conduct a trial based on the articles of impeachment passed by the House and decide whether removing a president from office is warranted. It's also a historical precedent that the initial arguments in a Senate trial be limited to the testimony and evidence gathered by the House. 'During initial presentations, the Senate will only hear arguments from the record---the record the House built. After that initial phase, we can call in additional witnesses as needed. The argument that the Senate should be expanding investigations before initial arguments are even presented is a tacit acknowledgment on the part of some Democrats of what we all know to be true: the House rushed and failed to complete its duty thoroughly, making a mockery of the impeachment process.\nMrs. Pelosi said on the House floor Wednesday that her month delay allowed new 'evidence' to emerge. But if that's true, why did the House rush its votes before the holiday? In any case the new evidence she cites is merely more detail about what we already know. Mr. Trump exhibited poor judgment in unleashing Rudy Giuliani to ask Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. but he broke no law, and other Presidents have tried to use foreign policy to serve domestic political ends. Voters may conclude these are grounds for denying Mr. Trump re-election. But if they are enough to short-circuit a presidential term, then many more Presidents will be impeached. 'At this stage we don't see what good would be done by calling Senate witnesses. If Mr. Bolton is called, then Republicans may call Hunter or Joe Biden or both. This would be a circus, and it would pay too much homage to the flimsy House evidence and rigged process. The Senate may not even need to hear from the President's defense team. Let the House managers make their case. If a majority of Senators believe the evidence is as inadequate as we do, then repudiate this impeachment with votes to acquit on both articles.",
