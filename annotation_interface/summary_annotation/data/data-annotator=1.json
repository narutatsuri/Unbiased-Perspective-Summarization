Political posturing might have mattered to governors who'd like to be president someday, but it made no difference to the millions of children in the nation's schools.\nPresident Joe Biden can be doing far more to call public attention to the crisis and mobilize all levels of government to address it, including accelerating efforts to recruit and train tutors focused on highly vulnerable students. It's also imperative that all students spend more time in class to help make up the lost ground. 'School districts should use federal relief funds to increase instructional time, lengthen the academic year, expand summer-school slots, and launch more 'Saturday academies'---preferably all of the above. Schools should provide bonuses for teachers willing to work during the summer and on weekends. 'The Biden administration also needs to encourage more innovation in the public-school system by funding high-quality public charter schools. The US has the resources to help students recover from the pandemic. What it needs is the will.\n\nRight:\nCatholic schools almost everywhere were open full time by the fall of 2020, and on aggregate, the data show that they avoided the worst of the learning loss, avoiding declines in proficiency in fourth grade math and eighth grade reading. Moreover, according to data analyzed by Harvard professor Martin R. West states that kept more schools open experienced smaller declines in proficiency than their peers.\nOnce it was clear that COVID was not a major threat to children, that they were neither likely to suffer severe symptoms nor to pass the disease to others, every schoolhouse in America should have reopened immediately for in-person instruction. That is to say, any jurisdiction that kept its schools closed in the fall of 2020 is guilty of letting students down despite knowing better.\nThe Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program was intended to pay for training in virtual learning while upgrading school ventilation systems and expanding the space available for social distancing. The obvious intent was to find a way to get the schools open again as soon as possible. Now, a review of the funds allocated for ESSER provides a more complete picture of what happened. As it turns out, less than half of that money was ever spent.\nThe least money was spent in the districts where student performance fell the furthest behind. It's not hard to interpret what that means. The school systems that ignored the money and took the longest to reopen were the ones where the children suffered the most deleterious effects from the lockdowns.\nKeri Rodrigues from the National Parents Union noted that the excuses offered by the schools always focus on a lack of money and how they need more money. But now, as Rodrigues views it, 'we have a historic amount of spending, like never before, and you're not even spending the money. \nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona acknowledged that the decline is serious. Yet you wouldn't know it from the lackadaisical responses to learning loss from teacher-union leaders. Most (in)famous were the comments of Los Angeles union boss Cecily Myart-Cruz. 'There's no such thing as learning loss,  she claimed.\nThe Chicago Teachers Union, meanwhile, calls learning loss a 'contrived notion.  And Becky Pringle, head of the National Education Association, says she doesn't use the term learning loss 'because students are always learning. .\nSuch deflections aren't surprising, given the large role the unions played in keeping so many schools closed to in-person learning---unlike systems in Europe and Asia. We're not going to do right by this generation of students with happy talk and political spin. It's time for all leaders---including union leaders---to acknowledge that we have a big problem, and we'd better get busy working on solving it.",
        "document": "The sudden onset of the pandemic has been the most catastrophic event in recent American history, making the expectation that there would not be something called 'learning loss' bizarre. The idea that life would simply churn on in the same way it always has only underscores the extent to which there have been two distinct experiences of the pandemic. One for people who experienced the upheaval but were able to sequester themselves away from its harshest realities. 'There was another gruesome reality, reaped by poor and working-class families in the surreal numbers of people who have died. By August, 2020 fifty-seven percent of Black American adults said that they knew someone hospitalized or dead as a result of the virus, compared to thirty-four per cent of white American adults. Black and Latino kids lost their caregivers at nearly twice the rate of white children. As one expert reminded us, 'Bereavement is the No. 1 predictor of poor school outcomes. \nRepublican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas made a big show of reopening their states' schools in the fall of 2020, with DeSantis going so far as to threaten to withhold funding from school districts that did not comply. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, on the other hand, moved more slowly. But the NAEP report showed that student performance suffered equally despite the different approaches. 'Math scores for fourth-graders dropped by four points in California, five points in Florida and five points in Texas. For eighth-graders, scores dropped by six points in California, seven points in Florida and seven points in Texas. Scores in reading in those three states also moved in lockstep, falling by a point or two.

Maybe the campaign we should all promote is 'Can we all be better? \n\nRight:\nThe age-old mistake, which has stunted countless lives, is the assumption that because physical hardship in childhood makes you physically tough, emotional hardship must make you emotionally tough. It does the opposite. It implants a vulnerability that can require a lifetime of love and therapy to repair and that, untreated, leads to an escalating series of destructive behaviours. Emotionally damaged men all too often rip apart their own lives, and those of their partners and children.\nThe striking thing about conservative responses is how they assume that traditional masculinity and men are one and the same. what if you're not that way? What if you're a boy who would rather play with dolls than guns? What if you're queer or trans? What if, as a man, you're sometimes depressed, or scared, as all human beings are? . 'In trying to live up to traditional ideals of manliness, men are often reluctant to ask for help when they are in distress. This can make it difficult for psychologists to identify depression in men, which is part of the reason why men are less often diagnosed with depression, and why they have suicide rates as much as three times that of women. Traditional masculinity also tends to celebrate male violence, which is partially responsible for the fact that men commit 90% of violent crimes.\nInterestingly, some say that 'far from radical, the Gillette commercial is actually deeply traditional, even conservative, in its depiction of masculinity. Rather than an attack on manhood or a radical call to overthrow the patriarchy, the commercial instead celebrates men and affirms long-standing notions of masculinity as honorable and virtuous. the bulk of the commercial shows men saving the day: breaking up fistfights, defending a woman's honor, fulfilling their parental duties. If chivalry had a national media campaign, this is what it would look like.\nIt doesn't take a sociologist or a psychologist to recognize a lot of guilt and fear masquerading as anger. It's not an attack on men, by the way. It's an attack on inappropriate and abusive behavior by men. So if you don't engage in that, what's there to worry about?\nRegarding its effectiveness, some say that the ad 'is similar in spirit to, say, Dove's long-running 'Campaign for Real Beauty' campaign, which points out the many ways in which women can be their own worst enemy when it comes to their self-image. But while we are used to this type of prescriptive ad messaging targeting women and their emotions, men are more often appealed to with humor and lighthearted quips or sex-based appeals. This ad has made men think of Gillette as more than just another manufacturer of razors but as a brand with meaning and with values and, perhaps, part of their journey to manhood.\nOthers think the ad fell flat. 'The ad was directed by British agency Somesuch's Kim Gehrig, who did the highly impactful 2015 This Girl Can advertising campaign for Sport England. But the feminist activism that animated both ads doesn't have the same impact on both audiences. I love both these ads. They speak to me and inspire me. But I'm not the target of the second one. It's taken decades for companies to learn to talk to women. Now the ruckus around Gillette's latest ad, The Best Men Can Be, shows it's high time we also learn to talk to the modern men.\nFinally, some point out that 'the campaign is engineered to mine as much buzz from as many sources as possible. It's a heat-seeking missile aimed at the thinkpiece industry. It's also a kind of political Rorschach test built to twig the amygdalas of anyone at the intersection of outrage-prone and Twitter-adjacent. The only thing this ad campaign isn't? A commitment to do anything other than sell razors.",
        "document": "The ad 'didn't strike me as a reproof of masculinity per se but rather as a critique of bullying, boorishness, and sexual misconduct. Some men arebehaving really badly---harassing women, bullying each other, and failing in their family responsibilities. encouraging men to be non-violent, polite, and respectful is not anti-male. It's just civilized. 'Conservatives should applaud that aspect of the Gillette message. Progressives, in turn, should grapple with the overwhelming evidence that the best way to raise honorable men is with two parents. We may wish it were otherwise, but fathers---as disciplinarians, role models, and loving husbands---are key to rearing happy, healthy, and responsible sons as well as self-confident, happy, and high-achieving daughters.\nIf we truly believe that young men are growing up inculcated into a toxic vision of masculinity, is that from too much traditional male influence or too little? Today, according to the U. S. Census Bureau, 23 percent of American children live with a single mother. That percentage has tripled since 1960. 'More and more young boys lack male influence altogether. If you want to raise a generation of men who will treat women well, act as protectors rather than victimizers, and become the bedrock for a stable society, you need more masculinity, not less.\nThe social change Gillette and progressive activists want, it turns out, is a return to the moral and social values the conservative movement has been shouting from the rooftops for decades. Both young men and women have been told for decades to sexually objectify themselves and consider their impulses sacred rights rather than denying themselves through responsible behaviors. The culture has downgraded marriage and the family.\nMen have been on a downward trajectory for some time now. Fewer men go to college, more men commit suicide, more men live at home with their parents well into adulthood. Men take the most dangerous jobs, they fight and die in our wars, yet they are told nonstop that they are terrible, and the future isn't for them. They are expected to shrug it off because, well, they are men.\nTo many men---and women, especially women with sons, I'd guess---criticism of 'toxic masculinity' at this particular cultural moment feels a bit like lefties lecturing Trump's working-class base about white privilege. There's merit to the criticism, but to someone who's lower-class, with poor job prospects, buried in a community with addiction problems, 'check your privilege' isn't just a hard sell, it's potential cause for offense.\nWhen taken in the context of all the other recent attacks on traditional masculinitynot least that recent APA report that diagnoses totally normal, typical male behavior as somehow dangerous and toxica disturbing pattern is starting to emerge. It's almost as if this stuff is a concerted effort to devalue menentirely, hanging the sins of a boorish few on all of us.\nSome argue that 'if we're going to stick with the toxic masculinity shtick and guilt all men into expressing a more feminized 'masculinity,  we need to at least play fair and admit that women have their own issues that can be just as hurtful as men's. 'Girls suffer at the hands of other girls in ways that often go unnoticed. Backstabbing, manipulating, gossiping, and other forms of relational aggression cause victims to suffer from high rates of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and profound loneliness and social isolation, which sometimes drive girls to suicide.

        "input": "Given texts from both Left-leaning and Right-leaning perspectives, summarize only the Left-leaning perspective in one sentence, starting with 'The Left '. ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nThe book excerpt is a horror movie of GOP cowardice and hypocrisy, delivered with astonishing specificity: We learn of Sen. Mitch McConnell describing Trump as 'an idiot. He doesn't think when he says things.  We meet various Senate Republicans who 'played their parts as Trump loyalists,  in public, yet in private, 'they ridiculed his ignorance, rolled their eyes at his antics, and made incisive observations about his warped, toddlerlike psyche.  Trump briefs a fawning GOP caucus lunch that gives him a standing ovation, then explodes in laughter when he leaves the room.\n'One Republican congressman confided to Romney that he wanted to vote for Trump's second impeachment, but chose not to out of fear for his family's safety,  Coppins writes. 'The congressman reasoned that Trump would be impeached by House Democrats with or without him---why put his wife and children at risk if it wouldn't change the outcome? Later, during the Senate trial, Romney heard the same calculation while talking with a small group of Republican colleagues. .\nEven if there was no credible threat against the legislators with whom Romney spoke, the threat was perceived as credible and it affected their decision-making. Sure, they might simply have been pointing at this fear as a rationale for taking the position popular with their base but, again, this was in the immediate aftermath of the riot. What senator present in the Capitol that day wouldn't think a viable threat existed?\nThe significance of this admission cannot be understated. It reveals that the violent threat from the extremist right did not end after the Capitol was retaken on January 6; indeed, the threat of violence had more effect in the days afterward, swaying the votes of terrified legislators. The failure to convict Trump is one of the most consequential decisions in American history. Had Republicans kept their nerve, Trump would now be disqualified for the presidency, rather than poised to retake it. That decision was arrived at not through conviction, or even political calculation, but functionally at gunpoint.\nWhat comes through with depressing clarity in Coppins's account is the vast disconnect between Romney's public and private assessments of his party. Behind closed doors, he scathingly indicts the GOP as a proto-authoritarian formation. In public, he only hints at these beliefs.\nRomney's announcement wasn't all doom and gloom. He expressed hope that his vision for the party might ultimately win the day. 'If it can change in the direction of a populist,  Romney told Balz of his party, 'it can change back in the direction of my wing of the Republican Party.  He added, 'I think we have the leverage of being right, and in the final analysis, right will prevail.  The problem is that those willing to try to push the party in that 'right' direction keep leaving, often voluntarily or with a not-so-friendly nudge from GOP primary voters.\n\nRight:\nThroughout his political career, Romney has been the right man in the wrong time. If you were choosing a leader for any sort of enterprise, Mitt Romney is the kind of man you would pick: smart, polished, incorruptible, tireless, focused on the goal and on leaving nobody in his charge behind. Political leadership in America, however, is not just about management. It is fundamentally a contest of ideas.\nFor all of Romney's earnestness, he always struck me as a man deeply cynical about politics (in large part because of the traumatic experience of seeing his father's reputation destroyed over a single poor word choice) and utterly lacking in political principles. That's how he told equally persuasive stories about his conversions to the pro-choice and pro-life causes at different stages of his career. As I wrote in 2012, 'The dual conversion narrative leaves both positions sounding hollow and insincere: St. Paul only went to Damascus the one time. \nMitt Romney's first and final belief is in Mitt Romney. This is why he left his home state of Michigan first to build a fortune. As chairman of one of the largest private investment firms on the planet, Romney was complicit in the theft of innumerable American jobs. It is why, in that first successful campaign, Romney abandoned any pretense of both principle and conservatism, racing his opponent to the left on abortion, homosexuality, and just about everything else besides a promise to cut taxes.\nIt is why he ran for president of the United States in 2012.

Even Mr. Biden said in December 2020 it was 'pretty questionable' whether he had authority to cancel debt this way.\n\nRight:\nThe White House estimates that people making less than $75, 000 per year will represent 90 percent of its proposed relief. A college education does not guarantee personal wealth, and student-loan debt by definition excludes the truly rich. A Rockefeller doesn't need to take out student loans to pay for college. Most debtors, in fact, had Pell Grants, designed for 'undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need.  Biden's plan is hardly some giveaway to the American elite.\nA 36-year-old today who went straight to college from high school graduated right into the teeth of the Great Recession, when career-starting jobs were incredibly scarce. For many, graduate school felt like a safe harbor and good long-term investment---or so the college recruiters said. But that meant loans for living expenses along with pricey tuition, which can quickly inflate balances to $100, 000 or more.\nThe core argument for debt forgiveness is not that college graduates are more deserving than their degree-less peers. It's that there are enough public resources to help both, and that graduates in the present are worse off than graduates in the past who benefited from more affordable public university tuition and weren't thrown defenseless into an economic catastrophe.\nFor decades now, the government has been shoveling subsidies into colleges and universities, and (with a few exceptions) they have responded by jacking their prices through the roof. Biden can't do this by himself, of course, but it's long since time for the government to start demanding a better deal.\nOne option would be attaching even more stiff regulations to federally subsidized student loanssimply requiring institutions to cut down on fancy amenities, administrative bloat, and so forth. The administration has announced that the Department of Education would 'hold accountable colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis,  but this consists of an annual watch list of college programs with high debt levels, and strongly worded letters to colleges asking for 'institutional improvement plans.  Obviously, this could be stronger.\nThe average student debt load on graduation is more than $30, 000, and the average student debt-to-income ratio is 55 percent. Biden's student debt relief plan is a superb Band-Aid, but it's a Band-Aid. We shouldn't kid ourselves that the student loan solution to funding higher education will last much longer. It's going to collapse, and before it does we should start moving toward a national policy that provides a college education, debt-free, to anyone who wants it.",

How do you distinguish yourself from the also-rans? How do you displace Trump without taking him on directly? Only 45 men have ever been president of the United States. It's an office that doesn't fall into your lap. If you want to be president, you can't be a wallflower. You've got to go take it.\n\nRight:\nThe candidates 'spent much of the debate pretending Trump wasn't even in the race. When candidates did draw seeming contrasts, they often avoided using Trump's name. About the closest anyone got to a true broadside against Trump was former New Jersey governor Chris Christie calling Trump's conduct---regardless of his guilt---'beneath the office of the president of the United States.\nOnly he and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said they wouldn't support a convicted Trump in the general election, with Hutchinson floating the idea that Trump's role in the Jan. 6 insurrection might have disqualified him to serve as president under the 14th Amendment. The risk for Trump in not showing up was that he wouldn't be able to defend himself. He didn't have to.\nThe big loser in all of this was DeSantis, who desperately needed to show he was still the clear second-place candidate, and failed to do so. Though he avoided adding to the gaffes that have sometimes haunted him on the campaign trail, he also added few highlights. He reached for personal anecdotes, including about his own children, and ended up sounding clinical. DeSantis also dodged question after question: He didn't explain how he'd cut federal spending, whether he wanted a federal ban on abortion, how he'd fight crime. or what to make of the Trump indictments.\nThere were surprises: Nikki Haley laid the blame on Republicans, not Democrats, over spending; Doug Burgum, the first of the field to pull out his pocket Constitution, offered an almost measured answer on abortion, while his stage-mates like DeSantis ranted about so-called 'post-birth' abortion (isn't this just. murder? ); and even the Fox News audience seemed to boo Ramaswamy for calling climate change a 'hoax.\nBut this is, at the end of the day, a contest between Trump and Anybody Else. If this debate was about anything, it was who would step up to fill that role. For all their punch throwingPence, answering a question about Biden's age, taking an apparent swipe at Ramaswamy for being 'too young'the candidates mostly just seemed too uniform, too preoccupied with 'wokeness' and other far-right inanities to differentiate themselves from the other Trump Lites.\nNearly everyone agreed that climate change was real but we shouldn't do anything about it. Everyone was in favor of securing our borders. Everyone agreed that our nation is in decline. Everyone (apparently) believed that American education is in crisis. In fact, almost every person on the stage agreed with everyone else. There was precious little actual debate.",

If this debate was about anything, it was who would step up to fill that role. For all their punch throwingPence, answering a question about Biden's age, taking an apparent swipe at Ramaswamy for being 'too young'the candidates mostly just seemed too uniform, too preoccupied with 'wokeness' and other far-right inanities to differentiate themselves from the other Trump Lites.\nNearly everyone agreed that climate change was real but we shouldn't do anything about it. Everyone was in favor of securing our borders. Everyone agreed that our nation is in decline. Everyone (apparently) believed that American education is in crisis. In fact, almost every person on the stage agreed with everyone else. There was precious little actual debate.\n\nRight:\nRon DeSantis had to counter the perception that his campaign is in free-fall, and he did a good job of explaining his greatest hits as Florida Governor on Covid and fighting progressive prosecutors. He said he would have sacked Anthony Fauci, a nice contrast with Mr. Trump's Covid delegation to the doctor. But the Governor also ducked more than one question, such as whether he'd support a national ban of 15 weeks on abortion.\nVivek Ramaswamy is close to Mr. DeSantis in the polls, and he has the gift of energy and verbal facility. He can sling appealing phrases, and his line that Americans are hungry for purpose will resonate with many voters. But he can also sound like a young man in too much of a hurry, and his rapid-fire one-liners and insults ('I'm the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for') give him the air of a supercilious grad student.\nIt was Vivek Ramaswamy's night in Milwaukee, but not necessarily in a way that advances his presidential ambitions. Not in the long term, anyway. The upstart Millennial candidate picked every fight he could with his fellow Republican aspirants. He struck out a number of untenable policy positions, all of which he justified by claiming that he alone had the 'courage' to court such risks. He swung for the fences in pursuit of as many viral moments as possible.\nBut by inviting the criticism he took, Ramaswamy provided Ron DeSantis with cover. There is a notion abroad---one that seems to have been internalized by the GOP field---that DeSantis is no longer Donald Trump's most viable challenger in the race.\nBut DeSantis polls strongest among Republicans, particularly in the early states. He is the best-funded candidate in the race, and his operation's organizational strength is formidable. And no one so much as laid a glove on him.\nMike Pence had serious, substantive exchanges on foreign policy, his role as vice president after the 2020 elections, abortion policy, and immigration and border security. Pence had a strong debate---arguably the strongest of any of the candidates. He presented himself with dignity.\nRegardless, the problem for all of these candidates remains the fundamental one: How do you convince the average center-right primary voter that you're a better choice to lead the Republican party into the future? How do you distinguish yourself from the also-rans? How do you displace Trump without taking him on directly? Only 45 men have ever been president of the United States. It's an office that doesn't fall into your lap. If you want to be president, you can't be a wallflower. You've got to go take it.",

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nBiden is right to call Putin a killer. Now he should declassify the proof. After Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza's second poisoning, in 2017, his wife traveled to Washington, where, with the support of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz. ), she provided samples of her husband's blood to the FBI for analysis. 'They did test them. And then they classified the results,  he said. 'He sued under the Freedom of Information Act and received several hundred pages of highly redacted documents. The papers show that the U.S. intelligence community thinks he was a victim of deliberate poisoning, but officials withheld the proof---the actual test results. 'Kara-Murza said he thinks that the Trump administration cut a deal with Russian security service chiefs during a meeting in Washington in which they agreed not to make the test results public. If Biden wants to send a signal to Moscow that he's taking a tougher line, there's a simple way to do it: Declassify Kara-Murza's test results.\nIt's worth remembering that the Obama administration's obsession with a Vladimir Putin 'reset' was a Joe Biden production. It was the reset that prompted the administration to remove a missile-defense system from Eastern Europe and worked to kill the Magnitsky Act---the sanctions bill named after Sergei Magnitsky, a whistleblower who was murdered by the Russian government. 'It was Biden who told Dmitry Medvedev, the lackey half of the Putin tandemocracy, that Russia's accession to the WTO was 'the most important item on our agenda.  A weird thing to gift a soulless dictator, I'd say. It was Biden who, one year before mocking Mitt Romney for his aggressive stance on Russia and accusing him of being a would-be slaveowner, praised Putin's stooge as 'one of the most powerful men in the world, and that's how we still think of you---I mean that sincerely. \nPutin's gangsterism has been ignored by administrations of both parties, starting with George W. Bush and most definitely including the Barack Obama/Biden terms. Almost literally the first thing Biden did in office was to extend an arms agreement with Putin despite US suspicions and evidence of Russian cheating on such treaties. Biden calls it a demonstration that we can 'walk and chew gum at the same time for places where it's in our mutual interest to to work together.  Putin likely sees it as more reason for impunity. 'Russia wasn't the only country that had been found to attempt interference in this election. The same intel report also found that Iran staged intel-propaganda operations to undercut Donald Trump. Will Iran also pay a price, or does Biden only plan payback for those who tried to make him look bad? So far, the administration keeps talking about how it wants to re-engage with Iran, not make them 'pay a price'. and Iran's mullahcracy has at least as much blood on their hands as Putin, much of it American blood. 'Ed Morrissey, Hot AirIn response to Biden's comments, 'Putin said 'I want to invite President Biden to continue our discussions, but on the condition that we do this actually live, online, but without any delay, but right in an open, direct discussion. He evidently believes the American president would slip up in any live interaction. former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told RIA Novosti that he had previously met 'Joe Biden at various international events. He gave the impression of being reasonable then. But apparently time hasn't been kind to him. 'Expect more Russian agitation toward the questioning of Biden's mental health. It's a preferable strategy for the Kremlin in three specific ways. First, it allows for a personal riposte to Biden's attack on Putin's character. 'Second, it plays to concerns in other governments that Biden is, perhaps, not as sharp as he once was. That is relevant in terms of the trust and confidence foundation, which ultimately underpins the U.S. -led liberal international order. Third, it offers a nice accoutrement to Putin's narrative that America is an archaic, weak, and corrupt nation built on shaky foundations.\n\nRight:\nDaniel Fried, an Atlantic Council fellow and former top U.S. diplomat, said that, while he could have worded it differently, what Biden said was truthful, noting opposition figures like Alexei Navalny who have been targeted and Russia's invasion of Crimea. 'I have little sympathy for the Russian expressions of feigned outrage and a great deal of sympathy for President Biden who is making a point, and he is saying let's call things by their name,  Fried said. 'Biden's approach is seen in part as an effort to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who did not forcefully push back on Russia for interfering in U.S. elections. 'It means the tenor of the relations has changed. It means that we're not talking nice about Putin and the Kremlin anymore and were not papering over what they're doing,  said Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia under former President Obama. 'The Russians now will have to decide whether they want the tenor and the actual relationship to improve because they would have to stop all the things they are doing,  Farkas added.\nOver and over, Trump was presented with questions about the frequency with which critics of Putin met with untimely ends. And over and over, Trump demurred, either shrugging at others' concerns or equating Putin's behavior with that of the United States. 'He kills journalists that don't agree with him,  Joe Scarborough said to Trump. 'Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe,  Trump replied. 'Nobody has proven that he's killed anyone,  Trump said on ABC's 'This Week.  He offered an odd addendum: 'You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. It has not been proven that he's killed reporters. \nBiden's conclusion is surely informed by the Kremlin's recent attempt to kill the Russian pro-democracy opposition figure Alexei Navalny last year and UK-based Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. Still, it's noteworthy to hear a president openly agree another world leader is a 'killer.  For example, when then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump the same question in 2017, Trump's response was: 'You think our country is so innocent?  and 'I do respect Putin. 'It's clear, then, that Biden is no fan of the Kremlin leader and is currently in no rush to improve US-Russia ties. However, he did conclude the Russia segment by noting both countries can work together when their interests align, citing the five-year extension of the New START nuclear arms control deal between the two countries earlier this year. Put together, the Biden administration will remain tough on Russia and Putin in particular. But if they can find areas of mutual interest, then Washington and Moscow might be able to put their differences aside---at least temporarily. 'Alex Ward, VoxSome note that, 'Generally speaking, when you call someone a killer, you follow it up with action, though as the recent case of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shows, that's not the case for everyone. Similarly to its handling of the investigation of MBS's role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration has declassified an intelligence finding that Russia's FSB security agency was behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has announced new sanctions against a number of Russian officials in response, but none targeting Putin himself. (The Russian president is in direct control of the FSB. ). 'Ultimately the 'killer' affair may have more to do with domestic politics in both countries than foreign policy. All Biden really did was repeat a story he's been telling for years, and concur with his own intelligence agencies' assessments of Putin's activities. But by choosing to do it, he did draw a contrast with Trump. 'The Trump years opened up a wide partisan gap in U.S. views on Putin, and it's hard to imagine Biden will suffer politically for criticizing the Russian leader, no matter how glibly. As for Putin, he's been using international crises to deflect attention from problems at home for decades now.",
