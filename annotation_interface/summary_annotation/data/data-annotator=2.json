Biden's plan is hardly some giveaway to the American elite.\n\nA 36-year-old today who went straight to college from high school graduated right into the teeth of the Great Recession, when career-starting jobs were incredibly scarce. For many, graduate school felt like a safe harbor and good long-term investment---or so the college recruiters said. But that meant loans for living expenses along with pricey tuition, which can quickly inflate balances to $100, 000 or more.\n\nThe core argument for debt forgiveness is not that college graduates are more deserving than their degree-less peers. It's that there are enough public resources to help both, and that graduates in the present are worse off than graduates in the past who benefited from more affordable public university tuition and weren't thrown defenseless into an economic catastrophe.\n\nFor decades now, the government has been shoveling subsidies into colleges and universities, and (with a few exceptions) they have responded by jacking their prices through the roof. Biden can't do this by himself, of course, but it's long since time for the government to start demanding a better deal.\n\nOne option would be attaching even more stiff regulations to federally subsidized student loanssimply requiring institutions to cut down on fancy amenities, administrative bloat, and so forth. The administration has announced that the Department of Education would 'hold accountable colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis,  but this consists of an annual watch list of college programs with high debt levels, and strongly worded letters to colleges asking for 'institutional improvement plans.  Obviously, this could be stronger.\n\nThe average student debt load on graduation is more than $30, 000, and the average student debt-to-income ratio is 55 percent. Biden's student debt relief plan is a superb Band-Aid, but it's a Band-Aid. We shouldn't kid ourselves that the student loan solution to funding higher education will last much longer. It's going to collapse, and before it does we should start moving toward a national policy that provides a college education, debt-free, to anyone who wants it.\n\nRight:\nWe should eliminate the labyrinth of government grants, loans, subsidies and guarantees that assert an open-ended public commitment to financing anything a university can think to charge for. Public support should come at the state level through funding of state university systems and at the federal level through a simple, means-tested grant that covers, say, 50 percent of the median state's four-year public university tuition.\n\nWhere would students find additional funding for more expensive options? . Fortunately, institutions exist with the capital to finance all the necessary borrowing, the information to assess the wisdom of borrowing to enroll, the resources to help students succeed and the incentives to make the system work. Those institutions, of course, are the colleges themselves. Just as sellers provide financing for cars, capital goods and sometimes real estate, colleges should be expected to finance the education they provide.\n\nPaying a huge bribe to college graduates at a moment when Democrats' political fortunes are looking up is insanely risky, potentially even disastrous. Maybe the bribe works by tilting a few suburban swing voters who were leaning Republican back towards the Dems. But even if it does, that's a net loss for Democrats if it ends up tilting even more furious working-class voters into the GOP's column. Remember, most Americans haven't gone to college.\n\nA sane political party that's been bleeding working-class support to the GOP during the Trump era would have done something closer to the opposite of all that, engineering a way to bribe lower-class voters and sticking better-educated ones with the bill. They could have seized on Mitt Romney's child tax credit as an opportunity for bipartisan compromise, expecting that voters would credit the president's party on balance for its passage. Instead they're saddling Tim Ryan and other vulnerable Dems with indefensible regressive wealth redistribution on an enormous scale.\n\nIt's important to appreciate that there has never been an executive action of this costly magnitude in peacetime. Not Mr. Obama's immigration amnesties, not his Clean Power Plan, not Mr. Trump's border-wall fund diversion. Nothing comes close to this half-trillion-dollar or more executive coup. Congress authorized none of Mr. Biden's loan relief and appropriated no funds for it.\n\nCongress authorized none of Mr. Biden's loan relief and appropriated no funds for it. Even Mr. Biden said in December 2020 it was 'pretty questionable' whether he had authority to cancel debt this way.",

One official said that what the federal government has done so far has been inadequate and they want to 'actually underwrite the resources necessary for a national vaccination program.  To me this is significant not just in terms of financial resources, but it indicates that the Biden Administration will be actually taking some measure of responsibility for the vaccine situation instead of just passing the buck---treating it as a national issue requiring federal funding and some form of a national plan. 'The odd thing about this package, as described, is that while many of its provisions really are just emergency pandemic measures including stuff like the expanded CTC child tax credit, it really feels like it ought to be permanent policy. It's true, of course, that it will help out with pandemic-related hardship. But drastically reducing child poverty ought to be a forever goal, not just a 2021 goal. 'Matthew Yglesias, SubstackDated but relevant: 'The Child Tax Credit currently offers up to $2, 000 a year for families with significant earnings but little or nothing for many poor people. That's because households have to earn at least $2, 500 per year for the credit to be 'refundable,  or for it to count for households that don't have a positive tax liability. An American without any taxable income---say, a single mom with a kid who lives with family but doesn't have a job because of the recession or some other barrier---won't owe any taxes, but because their income falls below that $2, 500 a year threshold, they don't get any benefit. 'Even above $2, 500 per year the credit phases in slowly, at a rate of 15 percent. A parent has to earn at least $11, 833. 33 to qualify for the full refundable credit, a bar that the poorest households can't meet. The Biden proposal would expand the size of the child credit and make it fully available for all poor people regardless of earnings. If passed Poverty among children would fall from 14. 8 percent to 9. 5 percent, meaning 4 million kids would escape poverty.

Of the imperfect options available, Remain in Mexico (formally, the Migrant Protection Protocols) makes the most sense. The Biden administration has been begrudgingly working with the Mexican government to improve this program.\n\nLonger-term, the US needs comprehensive reforms that would pair increased funding for law enforcement and immigration courts with an expanded guest-worker program, which would relieve pressure on the border and ease labor shortages in the agriculture and food-producing industries. Meanwhile, added investment, public and private, in northern Central America could help stem the violence and poverty that have caused so many to flee in the first place. The problems at the southern border are complex but not unsolvable. They should never have reached this point of near-crisis. What's most needed now is leadership.\n\nLocal organizers in Washington have been frustrated for months at what they say is a 'vacuum of leadership' among officials in D. C. as the migrants arrived. 'There is just no support,  says Bianca Vazquez, a leader in the mutual aid response. 'We're crowdfunding a resettlement effort. . But their outrage escalated last week when Bowser called for the National Guard to help bring the situation under control, which aid volunteers condemned as a 'militarized response to a humanitarian crisis. .\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has failed for years to put together real immigration reform, and has not shown enough urgency under the Biden administration to meaningfully address the issue. Migrants, in short, are caught between the inhumane border posturing of Abbott and Ducey and the inaction of leaders in Washington.\n\nIf we analyze deterrence strategies as tools for reducing migration, it's clear that they've failed. In 2003 Customs and Border Protection apprehended just over 400, 000 people; in fiscal year 2019, the agency arrested more than 1. 1 million people. Under previous administrations, CBP has admitted that 'border security alone cannot overcome the powerful push factors of poverty and violence' that drive people out of their countries, and 'walls alone cannot prevent illegal migration.  But year after year, Congress has primarily funded deterrence policies.\n\nAt least 728 migrants died along both sides of the US-Mexico border last year. There are plenty of people who would gladly sponsor refugees if given the chancebut immigration authorities are often hostile to attempts to do so. Members of humanitarian aid groups in Arizona have been arrested for leaving gallons of water on migrant trails. Instead of criminalizing aid workers' efforts to keep migrants alive, the government could avoid these deaths altogether by letting people sponsor Haitian and Central American refugees.\n\nRight:\nThe Border Patrol reports it has encountered more than 1. 8 million illegally crossing migrants so far this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. That's more than all of the last fiscal year and more than double that of any single year during President Donald Trump's term. Indeed, border encounters for this fiscal year are on track to exceed the total for Trump's full four-year term.\n\nGovernment data show that roughly 903, 000 of these migrants were immediately deported under Title 42. The rest have been processed under Title 8, which allows migrants to seek asylum in the United States.

Taxing wealth also encourages people to shift their assets abroad or into difficult-to-value assets, or simply to understate what their wealth is worth. Many European countries have given up taxing wealth, and those that do impose wealth taxes derive only a small share of revenue from them.\n\nHow the IRS will determine which households are worth $100 million is unclear; the agency does not have the capabilities or manpower to do such a thing. And considering the volatility of markets, on what day would this income be assessed? If you lose money, do you get a credit? Why is it called a 'billionaire's tax' when it applies to millionaires, too? What types of assets will be subject to it? So far, no answers have been given to these questions, likely because no good ones exist.\n\nThere are a few obvious problems with Biden's latest folly. The first and most obvious is that the wealthy already pay a lot more than their proportionate share of federal income tax: According to IRS figures, the top 10 percent of households by income already pay more than 70 percent of all federal income taxes, though they collectively earn less than half of all income. The top 1 percent make about 20 percent of all income but pay 40 percent of the federal income tax.\n\nIf the Democrats want a Scandinavian-style welfare state, then let them propose Scandinavian-style taxes, too. What's different about the United States compared to the European welfare states admired by our progressives is not taxes on the very wealthy but taxes on those in the middle and upper-middle.\n\nIn the United States, a married couple earning $110, 000 a year (1. 5 times the median household income) would pay a top marginal rate of 22 percent; in Sweden, the equivalent couple (earning 1. 5 times the median income) would pay 57. 2 percent, a little more than two and a half times as much.\n\nThe president's budget includes $773 billion for the Defense Department, an increase of $30 billion over what Congress enacted last year (which was itself $29 billion more than the president had asked for). That request is certainly a lot of money, equivalent to about 3. 9 percent of the U. S. economy.\n\nBut 3. 9 percent of GDP is roughly what the defense budget was in 1995, after the peace dividend and reduction in forces that followed the end of the Cold War, when international tensions were much lower than they are now. The budget for defense (excluding funding for the intelligence community and the Department of Energy, which is responsible for America's nuclear weapons) also assumes that inflation for the coming fiscal year will be only 2. 3 percent, but inflation is running at 7. 5 percent. So the Department of Defense is losing ground to inflation.\n\nRight:\nNational Review notes that 'The top 1 percent make about 20 percent of all income but pay 40 percent of the federal income tax---their income-tax burden is twice their share of income.  This misleading statistic is a favorite of plutocrats, but it is deeply misleading.\n\nYes, the federal income tax is highly progressive. But the income tax is just one component of the federal tax code, and the federal tax code is just one component of the total tax code. Other federal taxes, as well as state and local taxes, are far more regressive, and Republicans are busily working to make them more so. If you look at the total redistributive effect of the tax code, it is quite modest.\n\nThere are several reasons why the tightly drawn class warfare between the two parties tends to recede into the background of the political debate. But the banal fact remains that redistribution in general, and taxing the rich in particular, remains the primary ground the two parties are fighting over on a daily basis. The best thing Biden can do for himself is to remind people of this.\n\nWith Ukraine in turmoil thanks to a Russian war of aggression and the world's stability threatened by an ascendant China, it makes sense that Biden would need a well-funded military. What makes less sense, though, is such robust military spending coupled with claims that the country can't afford robust and necessary social welfare programs.\n\nThe need for the basic social support systems on offer in most of our economic peer nations -- affordable child care, universal health care, paid parental leave, even paid sick days -- became devastatingly clear when Covid-19 upended life as we knew it. Families need more than more affordable milk at the market; they need jobs that pay fairly, high-quality care for their children and their elders, and the ability to go to the doctor when they're sick without bankrupting themselves.\n\nSome note, 'China spends only a third of what we do on defense. Russia's military budget is around 8 percent of what ours is---yes, 8 percent. So how would spending $900 billion or $1 trillion a year thwart Putin's imperial dreams in a way that $800 billion a year won't? .\n\nThere are differences of opinion about the Biden administration's response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, but one thing we're not facing is a lack of resources. For instance, we've chosen not to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine because the administration believes (rightly) that it could lead to World War III. It's not because we don't have the means to do so if we chose. That's today, you might say, but what about tomorrow?

So the Department of Defense is losing ground to inflation.",
        "document": "National Review notes that 'The top 1 percent make about 20 percent of all income but pay 40 percent of the federal income tax---their income-tax burden is twice their share of income.  This misleading statistic is a favorite of plutocrats, but it is deeply misleading.\n\nYes, the federal income tax is highly progressive. But the income tax is just one component of the federal tax code, and the federal tax code is just one component of the total tax code. Other federal taxes, as well as state and local taxes, are far more regressive, and Republicans are busily working to make them more so. If you look at the total redistributive effect of the tax code, it is quite modest.\n\nThere are several reasons why the tightly drawn class warfare between the two parties tends to recede into the background of the political debate. But the banal fact remains that redistribution in general, and taxing the rich in particular, remains the primary ground the two parties are fighting over on a daily basis. The best thing Biden can do for himself is to remind people of this.\n\nWith Ukraine in turmoil thanks to a Russian war of aggression and the world's stability threatened by an ascendant China, it makes sense that Biden would need a well-funded military. What makes less sense, though, is such robust military spending coupled with claims that the country can't afford robust and necessary social welfare programs.\n\nThe need for the basic social support systems on offer in most of our economic peer nations -- affordable child care, universal health care, paid parental leave, even paid sick days -- became devastatingly clear when Covid-19 upended life as we knew it. Families need more than more affordable milk at the market; they need jobs that pay fairly, high-quality care for their children and their elders, and the ability to go to the doctor when they're sick without bankrupting themselves.\n\nSome note, 'China spends only a third of what we do on defense. Russia's military budget is around 8 percent of what ours is---yes, 8 percent. So how would spending $900 billion or $1 trillion a year thwart Putin's imperial dreams in a way that $800 billion a year won't? .\n\nThere are differences of opinion about the Biden administration's response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, but one thing we're not facing is a lack of resources. For instance, we've chosen not to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine because the administration believes (rightly) that it could lead to World War III. It's not because we don't have the means to do so if we chose. That's today, you might say, but what about tomorrow? Well, ask yourself: What precisely is the question the Ukraine war raises for which the answer is, 'We have to spend more money'? What would we like to do that we don't currently have the budget for?",

Imagine it happening in the latter days of the 2024 campaign, with Trump as the Republican nominee and the fate of the free world itself on the line. This is hardly an implausible hypothetical. There are, sadly, a million possibilitiesa health scare, a bad fall as McConnell experienced, just the accelerated condition of advanced old age. The reign of the octogenarians is a risky bet for a democracy.\n\nRight:\nMcConnell has noticeably aged since his bad fall in March, when he sustained a concussion and broken rib, and he should want, for his own sake and that of his colleagues, to go out on his own terms. The details can be left to McConnell, who deserves a large measure of deference. A leadership transition doesn't need to happen urgently, but the wheels should be turning.\n\nStepping aside from leadership would not necessarily require leaving the Senate; McConnell could, like Nancy Pelosi, remain in office, and he would doubtless remain influential so long as he is capable of serving. But the job of caucus leader demands more. The time has come for the Kentucky senator, after his long, impressive run, to make the decision to step aside from leadership.\n\nWe ought to add an upper age limit for president, Congress, and judges in order to head off crises before they happen and hopefully, at the margins, encourage some new blood. It is true that age is an imperfect proxy for the capacity to do the job, but the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are all but self-enforcing in a way that is impersonal and bipartisan.\n\nRemoving a president or a Supreme Court justice from office on grounds of mental or physical unfitness would instigate a titanic political power struggle; doing so because they'd hit a constitutional age limit would be a routine thing. Many state courts, for example, already have mandatory retirement ages. Adding such limits is likely to save us more grief than it will cost us in the services of wise old heads.\n\nOthers argue, 'We act as if these septuagenarians and octogenarians have been thrust upon us by some unknown force. We put them there. If three-quarters of voters truly believed President Joe Biden is too old for office, they would find someone else to run. But Democrats would rather pretend that the president. is an intellectual and physical dynamo because they want to hold onto power.\n\nThe reality is that when it matters, voters across the country love the old-timers---perhaps because they are known quantities or maybe they bring home the money or maybe people genuinely like them. If they didn't, none of them would be in Washington.\n\nWe agree that too many people cling to power for too long in Washington. But Senate leaders are chosen by their party colleagues, who are in the best position to judge Mr. McConnell's continuing abilities. If they think Mr. McConnell can still be an effective leader of an increasingly fractious GOP Senate conference, then he should stay in the job.",

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nRon DeSantis had to counter the perception that his campaign is in free-fall, and he did a good job of explaining his greatest hits as Florida Governor on Covid and fighting progressive prosecutors. He said he would have sacked Anthony Fauci, a nice contrast with Mr. Trump's Covid delegation to the doctor. But the Governor also ducked more than one question, such as whether he'd support a national ban of 15 weeks on abortion.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is close to Mr. DeSantis in the polls, and he has the gift of energy and verbal facility. He can sling appealing phrases, and his line that Americans are hungry for purpose will resonate with many voters. But he can also sound like a young man in too much of a hurry, and his rapid-fire one-liners and insults ('I'm the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for') give him the air of a supercilious grad student.\n\nIt was Vivek Ramaswamy's night in Milwaukee, but not necessarily in a way that advances his presidential ambitions. Not in the long term, anyway. The upstart Millennial candidate picked every fight he could with his fellow Republican aspirants. He struck out a number of untenable policy positions, all of which he justified by claiming that he alone had the 'courage' to court such risks. He swung for the fences in pursuit of as many viral moments as possible.\n\nBut by inviting the criticism he took, Ramaswamy provided Ron DeSantis with cover. There is a notion abroad---one that seems to have been internalized by the GOP field---that DeSantis is no longer Donald Trump's most viable challenger in the race.\n\nBut DeSantis polls strongest among Republicans, particularly in the early states. He is the best-funded candidate in the race, and his operation's organizational strength is formidable. And no one so much as laid a glove on him.\n\nMike Pence had serious, substantive exchanges on foreign policy, his role as vice president after the 2020 elections, abortion policy, and immigration and border security. Pence had a strong debate---arguably the strongest of any of the candidates. He presented himself with dignity.\n\nRegardless, the problem for all of these candidates remains the fundamental one: How do you convince the average center-right primary voter that you're a better choice to lead the Republican party into the future? How do you distinguish yourself from the also-rans? How do you displace Trump without taking him on directly? Only 45 men have ever been president of the United States. It's an office that doesn't fall into your lap. If you want to be president, you can't be a wallflower. You've got to go take it.\n\nRight:\nThe candidates 'spent much of the debate pretending Trump wasn't even in the race. When candidates did draw seeming contrasts, they often avoided using Trump's name. About the closest anyone got to a true broadside against Trump was former New Jersey governor Chris Christie calling Trump's conduct---regardless of his guilt---'beneath the office of the president of the United States.\n\nOnly he and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said they wouldn't support a convicted Trump in the general election, with Hutchinson floating the idea that Trump's role in the Jan. 6 insurrection might have disqualified him to serve as president under the 14th Amendment. The risk for Trump in not showing up was that he wouldn't be able to defend himself. He didn't have to.\n\nThe big loser in all of this was DeSantis, who desperately needed to show he was still the clear second-place candidate, and failed to do so.

NATO at 70 is a challenged alliance but still a necessary one.\n\nDated But Relevant: 'Germany, one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, spends just 1. 24 percent of its gross domestic product on defense---in the bottom half of NATO allies. (The U.S. spends 3.5 percent of GDP on its military. ). a German parliamentary investigation found that 'at the end of 2017, no submarines and none of the air force's 14 large transport planes were available for deployment due to repairs,  and 'a Defense Ministry paper revealed German soldiers did not have enough protective vests, winter clothing or tents to adequately take part in a major NATO mission'. NATO needs some tough love, and Trump is delivering it.\n\nThe time has also come for NATO and American leaders to say publicly what has long been known privately: that the actions of the current Hungarian government, both at home and in their relations with Ukraine, run counter to their longstanding commitment to NATO and do not keep faith with the commitment the United States has made to Hungary. Since 2017, the Hungarian government has blocked meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission, the official body for consultations between the alliance and Ukraine. Hungary did so over U.S. objections and at a time of ongoing Russian military hostilities and political subversion against Ukraine.\n\nSome argue furthermore that 'increasingly, Turkey is no friend to America or the West. In fact, Turkey would not be invited to join the alliance today. Its international objectives are too divergent and its domestic institutions are too authoritarian. Rather than desperately attempting to hold Ankara in NATO, the allies should begin considering how to ease Turkey out. There will still be issues where we need to cooperate with Ankara. However, Washington should stop making policy based on illusions of friendship with a government seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire. Turkey today is neither friend nor ally. The U.S. should treat it accordingly.\n\nMinority view: 'With the Soviet Union a wasted corpse twenty-seven years after its death, what is NATO's purpose? Is a revanchist but nonetheless economically stagnant Russia really interested (let alone capable) of invading the Baltics? And with so many other priorities on its desk, is it time for the United States to at the very least transfer more security responsibility for Europe to the Europeans?",

ONLY RETURN THE SUMMARY AND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nLeft:\nBiden is right to call Putin a killer. Now he should declassify the proof. After Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza's second poisoning, in 2017, his wife traveled to Washington, where, with the support of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz. ), she provided samples of her husband's blood to the FBI for analysis. 'They did test them. And then they classified the results,  he said. 'He sued under the Freedom of Information Act and received several hundred pages of highly redacted documents. The papers show that the U.S. intelligence community thinks he was a victim of deliberate poisoning, but officials withheld the proof---the actual test results. 'Kara-Murza said he thinks that the Trump administration cut a deal with Russian security service chiefs during a meeting in Washington in which they agreed not to make the test results public. If Biden wants to send a signal to Moscow that he's taking a tougher line, there's a simple way to do it: Declassify Kara-Murza's test results.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the Obama administration's obsession with a Vladimir Putin 'reset' was a Joe Biden production. It was the reset that prompted the administration to remove a missile-defense system from Eastern Europe and worked to kill the Magnitsky Act---the sanctions bill named after Sergei Magnitsky, a whistleblower who was murdered by the Russian government. 'It was Biden who told Dmitry Medvedev, the lackey half of the Putin tandemocracy, that Russia's accession to the WTO was 'the most important item on our agenda.  A weird thing to gift a soulless dictator, I'd say. It was Biden who, one year before mocking Mitt Romney for his aggressive stance on Russia and accusing him of being a would-be slaveowner, praised Putin's stooge as 'one of the most powerful men in the world, and that's how we still think of you---I mean that sincerely. \n\nPutin's gangsterism has been ignored by administrations of both parties, starting with George W. Bush and most definitely including the Barack Obama/Biden terms. Almost literally the first thing Biden did in office was to extend an arms agreement with Putin despite US suspicions and evidence of Russian cheating on such treaties. Biden calls it a demonstration that we can 'walk and chew gum at the same time for places where it's in our mutual interest to to work together.  Putin likely sees it as more reason for impunity. 'Russia wasn't the only country that had been found to attempt interference in this election. The same intel report also found that Iran staged intel-propaganda operations to undercut Donald Trump. Will Iran also pay a price, or does Biden only plan payback for those who tried to make him look bad? So far, the administration keeps talking about how it wants to re-engage with Iran, not make them 'pay a price'. and Iran's mullahcracy has at least as much blood on their hands as Putin, much of it American blood. 'Ed Morrissey, Hot AirIn response to Biden's comments, 'Putin said 'I want to invite President Biden to continue our discussions, but on the condition that we do this actually live, online, but without any delay, but right in an open, direct discussion. He evidently believes the American president would slip up in any live interaction. former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told RIA Novosti that he had previously met 'Joe Biden at various international events. He gave the impression of being reasonable then. But apparently time hasn't been kind to him. 'Expect more Russian agitation toward the questioning of Biden's mental health. It's a preferable strategy for the Kremlin in three specific ways. First, it allows for a personal riposte to Biden's attack on Putin's character. 'Second, it plays to concerns in other governments that Biden is, perhaps, not as sharp as he once was. That is relevant in terms of the trust and confidence foundation, which ultimately underpins the U.S. -led liberal international order. Third, it offers a nice accoutrement to Putin's narrative that America is an archaic, weak, and corrupt nation built on shaky foundations.\n\nRight:\nDaniel Fried, an Atlantic Council fellow and former top U.S. diplomat, said that, while he could have worded it differently, what Biden said was truthful, noting opposition figures like Alexei Navalny who have been targeted and Russia's invasion of Crimea. 'I have little sympathy for the Russian expressions of feigned outrage and a great deal of sympathy for President Biden who is making a point, and he is saying let's call things by their name,  Fried said. 'Biden's approach is seen in part as an effort to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who did not forcefully push back on Russia for interfering in U.S. elections. 'It means the tenor of the relations has changed. It means that we're not talking nice about Putin and the Kremlin anymore and were not papering over what they're doing,  said Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia under former President Obama. 'The Russians now will have to decide whether they want the tenor and the actual relationship to improve because they would have to stop all the things they are doing,  Farkas added.\n\nOver and over, Trump was presented with questions about the frequency with which critics of Putin met with untimely ends. And over and over, Trump demurred, either shrugging at others' concerns or equating Putin's behavior with that of the United States. 'He kills journalists that don't agree with him,  Joe Scarborough said to Trump. 'Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe,  Trump replied. 'Nobody has proven that he's killed anyone,  Trump said on ABC's 'This Week.  He offered an odd addendum: 'You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. It has not been proven that he's killed reporters. \n\nBiden's conclusion is surely informed by the Kremlin's recent attempt to kill the Russian pro-democracy opposition figure Alexei Navalny last year and UK-based Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. Still, it's noteworthy to hear a president openly agree another world leader is a 'killer.  For example, when then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump the same question in 2017, Trump's response was: 'You think our country is so innocent?  and 'I do respect Putin. 'It's clear, then, that Biden is no fan of the Kremlin leader and is currently in no rush to improve US-Russia ties. However, he did conclude the Russia segment by noting both countries can work together when their interests align, citing the five-year extension of the New START nuclear arms control deal between the two countries earlier this year. Put together, the Biden administration will remain tough on Russia and Putin in particular. But if they can find areas of mutual interest, then Washington and Moscow might be able to put their differences aside---at least temporarily. 'Alex Ward, VoxSome note that, 'Generally speaking, when you call someone a killer, you follow it up with action, though as the recent case of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shows, that's not the case for everyone. Similarly to its handling of the investigation of MBS's role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration has declassified an intelligence finding that Russia's FSB security agency was behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has announced new sanctions against a number of Russian officials in response, but none targeting Putin himself. (The Russian president is in direct control of the FSB. ). 'Ultimately the 'killer' affair may have more to do with domestic politics in both countries than foreign policy. All Biden really did was repeat a story he's been telling for years, and concur with his own intelligence agencies' assessments of Putin's activities. But by choosing to do it, he did draw a contrast with Trump. 'The Trump years opened up a wide partisan gap in U.S. views on Putin, and it's hard to imagine Biden will suffer politically for criticizing the Russian leader, no matter how glibly. As for Putin, he's been using international crises to deflect attention from problems at home for decades now.",
