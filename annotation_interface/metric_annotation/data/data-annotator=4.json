        "document": "There's no question that organized criminal elements, including drug-trafficking organizations and Colombian guerrilla groups, have penetrated state institutions in Venezuela. The allegations are not surprising given the clear corruption and authoritarianism of the Maduro regime, and they are serious. But the Trump administration's rhetoric clearly isn't. Venezuela is not a major transit country for drugs bound for the United States. 'According to the U. S. interagency Consolidated Counterdrug Database (CCDB), 210 metric tons of cocaine passed through Venezuela in 2018. By comparison, in the same year about 10 times as much cocaine (2, 370 metric tons) passed through Colombia, and seven times as much cocaine (1, 400 metric tons) passed through Guatemala. So why is the Trump administration now raising the alarm about Venezuela 'flooding' the United States with cocaine, especially when the White House allowed anti-corruption efforts to die in more significant transit countries such as Honduras and Guatemala?\n\nIf there were anything that could force the Venezuelan government of President Nicolas Maduro and his opposition to work together, it might have been the coronavirus. With the pandemic closing in on a country woefully ill-prepared to confront it, the president's opponents had begun to test the waters of negotiating with him, with the hope that cooperation on a plan to fight the virus might lead to wider political agreement or eventually even new elections. But this past week, the United States torpedoed that possibility. 'President Trump has from early in his administration been eager to undermine Maduro as a way to win votes in southern Florida, where many refugees from Venezuela and its close ally Cuba tend to vote for conservative Republicans. He has been frustrated his team has not made more progress in ousting the socialist leader. 'It's difficult not to see an explicit political motive here in the indictments: maximize all possible pressure on the regime when they are hanging by a thread,  said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan think tank in Washington.\n\nMr. Maduro is already using Mr. Trump's move to bolster his support domestically and internationally. Countries including Mexico and Argentina, which are sympathetic to the Venezuelan regime, may call the charges exaggerated and cite international law to defy Washington. Mr. Maduro will keep denying the accusations, and claim the action against him is typical American interventionist meddling and extraterritorial application of its domestic legislation. 'Manuel Noriega was a U. S. toady before the George H. W. Bush's administration turned on him. Saddam Hussein bore the brunt of two American invasions before his execution. It does not seem likely that Mr. Trump would be willing to pay such a steep price for Mr. Maduro's demise. The Cubans, who play a crucial role in supporting the Maduro regime, have some experience in dealing with American hostility, warranted or not. The Castro brothers have outlasted 12 American presidents; Hugo Chavez and Mr. Maduro have outlasted four, if we include most of Mr. Trump's first term. The new measure, however valid on its merits, is not likely to alter the scoreboard.\n\nMeanwhile, 'The administration has shown little interest in measures to help Iran and Venezuela address the pandemic. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is right that Iran and Venezuela have squandered tens of billions of dollars on corruption, repression, and other malign activities that could have been used to fight the pandemic. But the reality right now is that sanctions should not compound human suffering by denying Iran and Venezuela the chance to purchase needed medical supplies, especially since dedicated humanitarian payment mechanisms can ensure that the funds are used only for that specific purpose.\n\nOn paper, the unilateral U. S. sanctions say that medical supplies are exempt. But this is an illusion. Neither Venezuela nor Iran can easily buy medical supplies, nor can they easily transport it into their countries, nor can they use them in their largely public sector health systems. If any firm trades with Venezuela's public sector, it could face secondary sanctions. When the U. S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked about the half-million Iraqi children who died because of U. S. sanctions, she said that those deaths were a price worth paying. They were certainly not a price that the Iraqis wanted to pay, nor now the Iranians or the Venezuelans, or indeed the majority of humankind."

        "document": "Maduro and his accomplices have caused millions of Venezuelans' suffering and have also devastated American communities with their drugs. Some people might think this action makes America the 'world's policeman' and might be concerned by it as a result. But it doesn't. As Barr noted, these people broke American laws and attempted to import hundreds of metric tons of cocaine to the United States, an amount large enough to kill millions of people. It's not policing the world to enforce U. S. law. 'Maduro should take note that the last time a foreign dictator was charged in the U. S. was in 1988, when Manuel Noriega of Panama was charged with very similar crimes. Noriega was captured in less than two years and ended up in an American prison.\n\nWhile the Obama administration did next to nothing, Hugo Chavez consolidated a dictatorship and aided narcoterrorists to torment the US ally Colombia. Drug traffickers partnered with kingpins in Caracas have decimated democratic institutions and strangled honest commerce in Central America. 'Venezuela has become a regional hub of transnational organized crime---a lawless global network with $2. 2 trillion in annual revenue. Narcotraffickers from Mexico and Colombia; henchmen from Cuba, Russia, China, and Iran; and terror groups from Colombia and the Middle East all derive money and power from Venezuela. It is time to unsheathe indictments and unleash tough security measures to bring criminals to justice.\n\nThese indictments are designed to put more pressure on Venezuelan military figures to abandon Maduro and put the legitimate interim president, Juan Guaido, in power. Maduro has been steadily escalating against Guaido this year, so increased questions were being asked as to how resolute the Trump administration was in its support for the interim president. These indictments confidently answer those questions. it is also important that the indictments do not focus on active uniform military officers who are heavily involved in the drug trade. The intended U. S. implication in turning a blind eye to these officers is that generals who now abandon Maduro can hope to avoid future U. S. criminal sanctions. 'But these indictments alone will not remove Maduro from power. More U. S. action will be needed if the generals are to decide to move against the pretender president. That means the U. S. should take decisive action, as requested by Guaido, to prevent Maduro's oil supplies from reaching Cuba. If Cuba is forced to abandon Maduro, his ability to intimidate and consolidate the military into his continued support will collapse. Still, these indictments are, in and of themselves, good news. They clarify America's position on Venezuela in a way that best serves our national interests and theirs.\n\nThe dual problem of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in oil prices have managed to create in two short weeks what a concerted American sanctions campaign could not achieve, which is a potential knockout blow to the Venezuelan legal economy. The illicit economy in illegal gold and drug trafficking, of course, will continue to grow at an alarming rate. The United States needs to stay vigilant against the regime and trust the external conditions improve its odds of success. Under these conditions, if the American government fails to achieve its goals of deposing Maduro and imposing democratic elections in Venezuela, then it might never achieve them in the end.\n\nSome, however, argue that 'With the coronavirus epidemic now beginning to impact an under-resourced and unprepared Venezuelan hospital system, regime change in Caracas would serve no purpose other than introducing a greater degree of anarchy inside the country. That, in turn, would result in more refugee flows, more humanitarian disaster within Venezuela's borders, and more destabilization in the region at large. 'The best way Washington can contribute is by getting out of the way, allowing its Latin American partners to take the lead in facilitating a diplomatic formula acceptable to both sides, and providing humanitarian aid to neighboring countries (like Colombia) that are in the unenviable position of managing the migration flows. Filing criminal charges against Nicolas Maduro may be emotionally satisfying for the investigators and prosecutors who have been working on this case. But in terms of foreign policy, this action seeks to replace one problem with another, a mistake that will have unintended humanitarian, political, and diplomatic repercussions."

        "document": "Adam Toledo's situation, perhaps like any such situation, is complex. The police officer had reason to believe that someone at the scene was armed. But it's also hard not to wonder why the situation couldn't have been defused without Adam being shot. This was a child, a 13-year-old. A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon? . 'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, 'despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. 'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.\n\nThe post-Floyd reckoning in the media has emphasized the need for journalists to look skeptically at claims from police and other officials following a killing, as they may come undone when more facts come to light. 'Shortly after the March 29 death of Toledo, a Cook County prosecutor claimed that Toledo was shot while holding a gun in his right hand. But body camera footage released on Thursday suggests this claim was inaccurate, as it appears to show the boy unarmed and with his hands raised when he was shot. Officials also described the incident as an 'armed confrontation,  without noting that Toledo had complied with officer instructions to drop the firearm and put his hands up.\n\nJustice for Adam Toledo requires investments in our Black and brown communities and disinvestments in policing. One would be a proposal by the Chicago-based, Black youth-led GoodKids MadCity collective called the Peace Book, which would create neighborhood peace commissions with resources sufficient to meet community needs. The resources include funds for positive youth spaces, political and art education, mental health treatment, restorative justice, and conflict resolution services. The Peace Book could operate with a diversion of just 2 percent, or $35 million, from the CPD's budget. 'Second, the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance, sponsored by Chicago Democratic Socialist Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and backed by a diverse, citywide coalition, would prohibit CPD officers from responding to people in mental health crises and instead fund community-based mental health professionals. Similar programs in Oregon both reduce police violence and better serve community needs.\n\nAt a young age, Adam was categorized as a special education student and separated from everyone else at school. Surrounded by the same six students with varying degrees of severe learning disabilities, Adam didn't have the chance to develop strong friendships with any of his classmates. 'According to one teacher 'It was clear he needed someone to talk to and the space to socialize himself better. He really liked to draw, his penmanship was perfect. I think if we offered an art class, he would've taken it, but we don't even offer that to our students. He just needed one friend, one classmate or one other student he could connect with'. 'Defunding the police' means providing us with adequate funding for after-school programming, violence prevention initiatives, creative arts curricula and workforce development opportunities. Chicago, known across the world as 'Chiraq,  has fostered street gang culture for more than a half century. I was 15 years old the first time a gang member gave me a pistol. As children, we normalize gun violence to the degree of no longer flinching at the sound of gunshots. Adam Toledo did not deserve to be killed by Chicago police. He, like many children from our side of the city, deserves more."

        "document": "Alito did not report the flight on his financial-disclosure forms, but as he noted in his Wall Street Journal op-ed, the rules until very recently were uniformly understood not to require any such disclosures. Judge A. Raymond Randolph, who was on the same fishing trip, told ProPublica that he sought disclosure advice at the time of a prior, similar trip and concluded that the trip didn't require disclosure.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2018, just counting the trips that were covered by the disclosure rules, justices disclosed taking 1, 306 trips that had been reimbursed by others. Six of the Supreme Court's nine members received paid trips to Europe in 2014, including to Berlin, London and Zurich---and 'New York University also paid for Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to travel to Florence, Italy.  In 2012, 'Ginsburg traveled to New York to accept Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year award, which came with a gift bag valued at $2, 500.\n\nThe one case involving Singer's litigious hedge funds that made its way before the Court on its merits was Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, a 2014 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act case involving Argentine sovereign debt. The case wasn't close; the Singer-related fund won 71. Moreover, even if Alito should arguably have recused himself for all time from Singer-related cases, the court papers in the case also didn't disclose---and weren't legally required to disclose---that the NML Capital fund was a Singer vehicle.\n\nProPublica and other captive outlets of the Democratic Party are doing whatever they can to create 'scandals' around the Supreme Court. It's not that they expect any particular faux-scandal to stick, but they hope that raising one after another will create a generalized perception that the court is corrupt, and its decisions---say, overturning affirmative action, or upholding gun rights---will thus be delegitimized, making it easier for Democratic officials to disobey them.\n\nAt the same time, the 'ethics' attacks on the court serve as a smokescreen to conceal the much bigger ethical problems that go unaddressed. ProPublica, for example, crusades against fully publicized matters like Alito's trip, even as it rakes in millions of dollars from undisclosed donors. Per the Washington Free Beacon: In 2020 and 2021, 'ProPublica accepted $6. 3 million from anonymous donors, and a quarter of the group's revenues in 2022 came from two unnamed donors. \n\nIf we are supposed to assume that casual exposure to billionaires is inherently corrupting, what does it say about ProPublica that its funding comes from organizations like the Sandler Foundation? That institution, which was described by Forbes magazine as having 'instituted borrowing practices that were largely blamed for the housing market collapse' in 2008, also financially supports the left-wing group Demand Justice, which advocates packing the Supreme Court.\n\nThis would be a shoddy indictment of ProPublica if it were the only prism through which we viewed its work. It is an exercise aimed at establishing guilt by association. But that is precisely the enterprise in which ProPublica is engaged. The Wall Street Journal editorial page deserves commendation for attempting to break the rhythm of this tawdry onslaught of defamation and agitation. Others should follow its lead."

Justice Gorsuch replies that the First Amendment makes both promises in a single sentence. 'A natural reading,  he says, 'suggest the Clauses have 'complementary' purposes, not warring ones.  He says the school punished Mr. Kennedy under 'a mistaken view that it had a duty to ferret out and suppress religious observances.\n\nThe Supreme Court is gradually restoring a proper constitutional understanding of the relationship between religion and the state. The Court in the 20th century began to use the Establishment Clause to let government restrict religious behavior and speech that is protected by the Free Exercise Clause. The Roberts Court's religious liberty rulings don't risk any state establishment of religion. But they do let Americans of faith express their viewsas the Founders intended.\n\nThere is no indication in the record that anyone expressed any coercion concerns to the district about the quiet, postgame prayers that Kennedy asked to continue and that led to his suspension. Nor is there any record evidence that students felt pressured to participate in these prayers.\n\nThe district suggests that any visible religious conduct by a teacher or coach should be deemedwithout more and as a matter of law impermissibly coercive on students. Such a rule would be a sure sign that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence had gone off the rails.\n\nInstead of a court-invented three-part test. Gorsuch and his five colleagues offer an empirical analysis of historical practices and understandings as a way to judge whether a government entity has violated the First Amendment by becoming too enmeshed in promoting religion. That is exactly as it should be. The original public meaning of the First Amendment, Gorsuch explained, 'counsels mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.\n\nGorsuch wrote: 'Learning to tolerate speech of prayer of all kinds is 'part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society,  a trait of character essential to 'a tolerant citizenry.  He also noted: 'Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse republic.  An assistant coach's noncoercive prayer, during a postgame interlude in which school policy otherwise offers him some free moments, burdens nobody."

        "document": "Do Democrats want to unfairly besmirch the entire GOP with the Jan. 6 disgrace, while distracting voters from 8. 6% inflation and $5-a-gallon gasoline? Yes. Yet did the committee offer a damning look at President Trump's scheme to stay in office after losing the 2020 election? Also yes. Fresh video of the riot is a reminder that Jan. 6 was a brutal melee of fists and chemical sprays.\n\nThe committee calls Jan. 6 an 'attempted coup.  That makes it seem as if there was a chance of success. There wasn't. It was an impossible plan hatched by screwballs, and it would have gone down as such if the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers hadn't breached the Capitol.\n\nOne irony is that the largely Democratic committee's evidence makes clear that Mr. Trump's designs on overturning the election were foiled mainly by Republicans, including many in his Administration. White House lawyers threatened to resign if he fired Justice Department officials who didn't indulge his fraud theories. GOP state legislators refused to name new electors. His judicial appointees rejected dubious fraud claims. Above all, his own Vice President stood up to Mr. Trump's public and private pressure not to count electoral votes.\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr compellingly explained that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Barr's solid account---based on facts and the law, and coming from a top Trump official who wanted the president to be reelected---would not have been impeached if Representatives Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, whom House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to appoint, had been seated on the committee and permitted to cross-examine Barr.\n\nConsequently, the testimony would have been more powerful: The opportunity to challenge Barr's account would have lent fact-finding integrity to the hearing, and the inability to shake his account would have enhanced our confidence that the hearing was getting to the truth. That is how real investigations and hearings work: They are adversarial proceedings. Alas, Pelosi chose not to play ball with McCarthy, turning the committee into an exercise in partisan theater, instead.\n\nDemocrats themselves used some very questionable legal pretexts to try to overturn a presidential election they lost in 2000 and insisted that the 2016 election was illegitimate. They will sometimes concede that their recent tolerance of political violence and their two decades of election rejection are a problem because they give Trump partisans a talking point, but that isn't nearly enough.\n\nIt's not just that you can't go from 'rioting is social justice' in July to 'riots are sedition' in January---it's that you shouldn't be starting from 'rioting is social justice' in the first place, and, if you are, you have already lost the game. The fact that Republicans have cynical, self-serving reasons for not taking the Democrats seriously does not erase the fact that there are excellent reasons for not taking the Democrats seriously.\n\nInstead of self-examination, Democrats offer: 'I don't get why these Republicans are so radical and angry, and, also, everybody who retweets a joke I don't like should lose his job'. And if these hearings go nowhere, which is likely, and if Democrats get pulverized in November, which also is likely, what are Democrats going to say? 'We just didn't realize how racist this country really is!  Because racism is why thinking people don't want Elizabeth Warren, the whitest woman since Eunice Wentworth Howell, in charge of writing our laws."

        "document": "Alito defends his non-disclosure by invoking the well-worn 'personal hospitality' exception. The reporting requirement in force in 2008, he says, excepted all 'accommodations and transportation for social events,  although it was recently clarified to require greater disclosure. In fact, the 2008 hospitality exclusion applied only to food, lodging and entertainment, with no mention of transportation.\n\nAlito can argue the finer points of disclosure and recusal, but there is a greater issue involving the justices' ready acceptance of lavish gifts from wealthy and politically active benefactors. Alito and Thomas, and perhaps others yet unknown, have not hesitated to vacation on the tab of the super-rich, rationalizing that they avoid talking law with their hosts, who, they assure themselves, do not have cases before the Court.\n\nBut influence does not arise only from outright favor-trading. Studies have shown that physicians' prescribing practices can be influenced by such minor gifts as pens, notepads and sandwiches. One study of over 125, 000 physicians found that receipt of a single inexpensive meal was associated with increased prescriptions of the donor's brand-name medication. Supreme Court justices no doubt believe they are immune to such effects, but so do doctors.\n\nCan anyone say with a straight face that no 'unbiased and reasonable person' would question the justice's impartiality when he votes for someone who gave him a valuable gift? Isn't there at least the appearance that something other than the strict application of the rule of law is at work? And appearances count, perhaps nowhere more than at the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of many of the most fraught issues of American life.\n\nIf the justices are confused as to the reason public trust in the court is in free fall, they need look no further than Justice Alito's smug, defensive reaction to a very fair criticism. As long as the court refuses to accept significantly stricter ethics rules, either adopted by themselves or imposed by Congress, that trust---and with it the court's legitimacy---will continue to erode until it's not worth a seat on a private jet.\n\nProPublica's reporting hints at the larger scandal of conservative donors becoming financially enmeshed with the justices they sponsor. Alito's stay at the resort 'was provided free of charge by another major donor to the conservative legal movement: Robin Arkley II,  it reports.\n\nAnd Singer's Supreme Court case 'featured an unusual intervention by the Judicial Crisis Network, a group affiliated with Leonard Leo known for spending millions on judicial confirmation fights. The group filed a brief supporting Singer, which appears to be the only Supreme Court friend-of-the-court brief in the organization's history.\n\nThe whole arrangement is highly convenient for the right: The conservative legal movement has seized unassailable control of the Supreme Court and its members are so deeply invested in the goals and worldview of the conservative movement and its donors that the component parts can hardly be separated. The most powerful body in the government happens to be the one that is allowed to follow the most lax ethics requirements."

To put it in perspective, NATO recently deployed 4, 500 troops in the Baltic nations to deter and repel a Russian tank assault. How many troops could possibly be needed to stave off an unarmed caravan of refugees walking up through Mexico? \n\nAccording to former Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, this is 'a misuse of active duty military. To say this isn't a political stunt is misleading the public.\n\nThe Trump administration has produced no evidence to support the president's repeated claims that criminals are in the caravan. Moreover Trump's claim that 'you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process' does not make sense. Many of the caravan members plan to request asylum, which requires that a person already be in the United States. \n\nNo doubt some of the caravan members will weigh the odds and decide they have a better chance of sneaking over illegally. But if even a few thousand were to try it, they would pose no unusual challenge to the Border Patrol---which apprehended nearly 6, 000 people every week last year crossing from Mexico. 'It's worth noting that while data specifically on refugees and those granted asylum are hard to come by. the New American Economy Research Fund looked at the 10 cities with the highest rates of refugee arrivals and found that 'nine out of 10 of the communities actually became considerably more safe, both in terms of their levels of violent and property crime'.\n\nSome posit that 'the United States has sabotaged itself. The migration crisis stems not from foreign nations duping the United States but rather from American economic development policies. that have exacerbated the poverty, despair and violence such policies were supposed to alleviate. \n\nOthers ask, 'What do we do when the caravan gets here? And more saliently: What do we do if many more caravans show up behind it? . This is not a passing crisis. It is the new normal, and its optics do nothing but intensify the cultural panic that is turning much of the West to authoritarianism as a response.

There are his tweets, many of which are weird enough to generate the right amount of viral confusion or are pugnacious enough toward Donald Trump to provoke the ire of the presidential Twitter feed. Then there are the influencers. Starting this week the Bloomberg campaign enlisted the help of a number of popular meme-makers to create sponsored Instagram content for the candidate. 'On Twitter, where some Democratic hopefuls have adopted a 'they go low, we go high' mentality, Bloombergians have instead opted to wade into the mud and wrestle with Mr. Trump's Twitter feed. For citizens looking for a movement or big, structural change or even just a genuine vision for the future of the country, the strategy is disheartening---just another brazen attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator instincts of the internet that leaves a sinking feeling that shameless memes, Twitter dunks and toxic screaming into the algorithmic void have become politics as usual. Or maybe it's always been this way. After all, what is politics if not a long, well-funded attempt at hacking people's attention?\n\nWhat's interesting here is that, even if Bloomberg doesn't win the nomination---which he very likely will not---this digital ad spending could end up mattering, anyway. That's because Bloomberg has pledged to spend a large fortune to dislodge Trump even if he's not the Democratic nominee. 'That a democratic socialist could end up as the nominee, even as Democrats end up relying in part on billionaire Bloomberg's money to fend off what may be the largest disinformation warfare campaign in U. S. history---one partly enabled by the threat the Big Tech oligarchy poses to democracy---is another measure of just how weirdly unsettled our politics are right now. It also hints at the odd compromises that might be necessary to survive the current crisis.\n\nThrow them up against the wall. It is impossible for me to imagine that those words would have rolled off Bloomberg's tongue had he been speaking to a room full of young black and brown men. Or, if people who looked like members of his own family faced that kind of scrutiny as they moved about their communities. In order for people to unfold their arms, he is going to have to face the wall of justified anger and absorb it at full blast. He has to be willing to talk about race and racism, not once or twice but with consistency and courage. 'He has to be willing to address the mind-set that created stop-and-frisk and keeps some version of it alive. And that means bringing cops to the table and pushing the leadership and the rank-and-file in blue to interrogate the social and racial factors that lead to disproportionate levels of scrutiny aimed at black and brown men. That will not be easy. But it is worth the risk. A leader who can create a pathway toward a model of policing that seeks justice, while facing up to historical injustice, would be doing a great thing for all of America.\n\n'Ninety-five percent of murders, murderers and murder victims' are male minorities between 16 to 25, Bloomberg said in 2015. This is actually not true -- not in New York City, and not nationwide. Lots of Democrats made significant mistakes in the 1990s when it came to being tough on crime -- mistakes that were readily apparent by the mid-2000s. But You cannot be the leader of a diverse, justice-oriented party when you said, just a few years ago -- well after we well knew just how damaging over-policing and mass incarceration are -- that 'the way you get the guns out of the kid's hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them. \n\nSome, however, argue that 'Bloomberg's mistakes. have to be weighed against a record of courageously speaking out and devoting enormous personal resources to virtually every progressive cause---gun control, abortion rights, climate change, Planned Parenthood, education reform for predominantly minority schools, affordable housing, income inequality and tax reform. And he has vowed as president to focus on building black wealth, not just ending poverty. Sitting here today, Bloomberg---paired with a progressive vice-presidential candidate who can appeal to Sanders's voters---has the best chance to carry the day."

But plenty of the cash is flowing to core American priorities: almost $12 billion in the latest round is for replenishing U. S. weapons stocks, and nearly $7 billion for U. S. troops in Europe.\n\nEconomist Timothy Ash wrote in November that Ukraine aid is 'an incredibly cost-effective investment,  burning up Russia's military power for a single-digit share of the Pentagon's annual budget, though Moscow is one of America's most formidable adversaries.\n\nMany of the same Republicans sneering at Mr. Zelensky will claim the U. S. needs to abandon Ukraine to focus on China. But Beijing and Moscow are working together to undermine the West. The best step the U. S. could take to deter another assault like Mr. Putin's is delivering to Ukraine more of the best long-range weapons, aircraft, missiles, tanks and other tools it needs to defeat the invasion.\n\nAt the same time, 'There is no end in sight for the war in Ukraine. If we're looking at $100 billion a year for as long as the war goes on, that could mean several hundred billion more dollars. Estimates for the costs of rebuilding Ukraine have ranged from $350 billion to $750 billion---and those estimates are only going to go higher.\n\nAnd yet, there has not been a real debate about whether we should be comfortable with that level of commitment, or, if so, how we should pay for it.\n\nThe national debt is at its highest level since World War II. If Mitch McConnell believes, as he has said, that the most important priority for Republicans in the defense budget is to deliver aid to Ukraine, he should say which aspects of the defense budget he views as being of lower priority, or identify cuts elsewhere in the budget to pay for it. If Democrats believe that funding Ukraine aid is critical, they should decide whether doing so is more important than protecting entitlements or advancing other spending priorities.\n\nSome argue, 'The most important challenge facing the United States, according to the leader of Senate Republicans, is shoveling more money to Ukraine? ! ? Not the massive crisis on America's southern border, which Washington has demonstrated no interest in solving. Not the drug abuse crisis (fentanyl) that is killing so many Americans. Not growing wealth inequality and related structural economic issues, which means that young people today are going to live materially worse lives than their parents. Not China, America's real geopolitical rival. Not rising crime.\n\nAll these things are happening in America, to Americans, but none of that matters to the Republican leadership as much as Ukraine. Let history show that while their own country fell apart, Republican leadership was more interested in this proxy war with Russia -- which, surprise! , ends up enriching defense contractors."
