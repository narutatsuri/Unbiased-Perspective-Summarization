        "document": "Barbie is an impressive achievement as a film and far, far funnier than any studio comedy I can remember in recent history. There are perfect jokes about everything from stilettos to boy bands to fascism and Matchbox Twenty; I'm still giggling at some of the gags.\n\nGerwig's solo directing career thus far (which includes Lady Bird and Little Women) is a triumph of reimagination, an exploration of what it means to find out who you are and not allow yourself to be shaped by nostalgia and sentimentality while also living with deep, real love. That she managed to infuse the same sensibilities into Barbie is something near a miracle.\n\n'If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you,  promises (or threatens) the trailer. Are audiences meant to cheer on the empowered girlboss exploits of the live-action embodiment of a now 64-year-old fashion doll? Or, on the contrary, should we be critiquing the male gazedriven industrial economy that made generations of little girls believe that the highest achievement of adult womanhood was an anatomically impossible waist-hip ratio? And what about those of us who grew up Barbie-indifferent? .\n\nYes, yes, and yes, responds Barbie: This movie is for you. Can any one movie be all those things at once? Gerwig's answer to that conundrum is to serve up a multilayered concoction that's as busy as a fully accessorized Dreamhouse: an earnest feminist manifesto inside a barbed social satire inside an effervescent musical comedy, all designed in colors and textures so sumptuous they make 1950s Technicolor look desaturated. Barbie never completely resolves the paradox at its heart. But it is a delight of improbable proportions.\n\nThe reactionary weirdoes decrying Barbie as peddling the 'woke' agenda haven't pulled much of a gotcha, accurately summarizing the textual substance of a film about one woman's sudden burst of institutional consciousness. Like a college freshman taking an intro class on gender---or perhaps like a high-schooler seeing a mass-market blockbuster with a developed political streak for the first time---Barbie becomes abruptly aware of the untenable societal pressures heaped upon womankind, released in a cathartic monologue by normal-person surrogate America Ferrera.\n\nShe resolves the many contradictions of the male gaze by slicing through the Gordian knot, simply concluding that whatever women want is fine, so long as everyone lets them live their lives in peace. It's a pretty anodyne statement. The steadfast refusal to coddle male ego may be the most unabashedly subversive notion in a project often conflicted about its opposing mandates as a critical work of art and a commercial good for sale."

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "We do not deny that committed same-sex relationships can and often do have much of great value: affection, mutual caregiving, love. Some same-sex relationships clearly exceed some opposite-sex ones in these important measures. But marriage as an institution, including its governmental dimension, does not exist to award certificates of worthiness on loving relationships. Love needs no license from the state.\n\nThe reason marriage was considered the union of one man and one woman until just yesterday is because such unions, and only such unions, often produce children. The law never took a purely instrumental view of marriage, one that regards it as worthwhile only insofar as it yields children. But it did regard it as oriented toward child-rearing.\n\nIt aimed, in a way that grew less coercive over time, to encourage adults to arrange their lives so that as many children as possible are raised and nurtured by their biological parents in a common household. Same-sex marriage was not the first step away from this model of marriage. Many social trends and legal developments have weakened the links between sex, marriage, and child-rearing. But that weakening has generally been regrettable rather than laudable. Republicans should reject the bill.\n\nTo disconnect marriage from a transcendent obligation to children, and to make it rather an expression of individual romantic feelings, is to fundamentally alter its character. Straight people did that before gay people ever started asking for marriage rights. Nevertheless, people like me correctly understood from the beginning that same-sex marriage was a Rubicon moment in advancing the Sexual Revolution. However strained the connection between marriage and its traditional purposes was under post-1960s cultural change, there was still the possibility of reform. With the normalization of same-sex marriage, that ended.\n\nBut 'The reality is that there is currently one vote on the Supreme Court to revisit Obergefell, which we know because Justice Clarence Thomas was the only one on the Court who signed on to the idea of revisiting it.\n\nThat's because overturning it would raise issues that striking down Roe did not. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in decisions in both Casey and Dobbs, 'reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.  In contrast, the reliance interests arguments are much stronger when it comes to Obergefell given that same-sex couples have already been making lifetime commitments for years based on the outcome of the decision. Unraveling the ruling is simply not tenable.\n\nSome argue, 'The issue, at least as I see it, has always been whether or not the government at any level should assume for itself the power to demand a permission slip (in the form of a license) and levy a tax (even if you call it a fee) for any two consenting adults to hold a private ceremony in front of friends and family that impacts not one other human being in the country and causes no harm. We should strike the word 'marriage' from the entire tax code. We should also repeal almost every law with the word marriage in it."

        "document": "By 1970, many leading environmentalists were predicting the end of the world. Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich was perhaps the leading apocalypse proponent. For Earth Day, he predicted that environmental deterioration would kill 65 million Americans, and that globally, 4 billion would die before the year 2000. Not only were these predictions spectacularly wrong, but they were outlandish when first made. Yet in a world where more alarm gets more attention, they started a trend of framing environmental issues in worst-case ways. The tone scares, it depresses---and it likely skews our focus and spending.\n\nThe progress of economies around the world shows that environmental quality and economic prosperity go hand in hand---they are allies, not enemies. Numerous studies show that once GDP per capita reaches a certain threshold, pollution begins to plummet. Human well-being is essential to responsible care for the environment, not the other way around. The best long-term solution for our environment is to promote freedom and economic growth. 'Over the last 50 years, the United States has dramatically reduced emissions of the six key pollutants that harm human health. Lead, ozone, carbon monoxide, and other harmful airborne substances have declined by 74%---all while our economy, population, vehicle miles traveled, and energy consumption have skyrocketed. Our cities are no longer shrouded by smog and toxic fumes, despite our dramatic growth. Our unprecedented environmental successes came not at the hands of big-government programs or stifling economic growth, but rather through a careful balance of reasonable, predictable regulations and free market innovation.\n\nThe U. S is itself only responsible for 14 percent of global emissions. To resolve a global challenge like atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations would require more international coordination and compliance than our present geopolitics would suggest is possible. If we cannot trust the Chinese Communist Party to relay critical epidemiological information, such as the virus's genetic sequence or even the number of deaths it has caused, why should we trust it, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to enforce emissions policies detrimental to the sectors that have enabled the country's economic ascent?\n\nSome ask, 'When did Republicans stop leading on environmental issues? Ours is the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who championed the protection of public lands; of Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the U. S. Forest Service (and later the governor of Pennsylvania); and Richard Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency. 'I continue to support policies that embrace all sources of energy, including natural gas, which has lowered our dependence on coal. I also support nuclear power, the largest around-the-clock provider of carbon-free energy. Yet many of my conservative friends have been reluctant to join me in supporting renewable technologies such as wind and solar. These and other advancements not only address dangerous greenhouse-gas emissions, but also are helping improve our economy with new jobs.\n\nEnvironmental policy technologist Matt Frost states, 'I don't think there's going to be any radical discontinuity in how humans choose to organize their lives and how they choose to make their lives more comfortable. I think that our policy emphasis should be on technology breakthroughs. We should be funding carbon capture research and bringing the price on that down. 'And I do think that cheap, clean, energy is something that---especially as the people in the developing world become wealthier---is tremendously popular. Energy is the primal commodity. And so an energy breakthrough is something that we should be pushing and wishing for on a popular level and funding from a policy level---just as much as if we were in the 70s. An energy breakthrough is absolutely where a lot of human imagination and engineering talent and resources should be devoted."

        "document": "For years, states have struggled to shore up deteriorating systems, much less move ahead with the new technology and projects needed to keep America competitive. Multiple administrations and Congresses talked about addressing the problem. 'Infrastructure week' became a running gag during Donald Trump's presidency, because of his constant invocation of the concept and complete inability to deliver on it. But Joe Biden has delivered. This is a major win for America.\n\nThere is a great deal to celebrate in the package, which independent economists say may create over half a million jobs. As well as investing in America's physical infrastructure like road, rail and broadband networks, it also makes the country's first major investment in helping communities prepare for extreme weather events caused by climate change. There's also chunks of money to upgrade the electrical grid and protect it from extreme weather, to expand the nation's network of electric vehicle charging stations, and to invest in experimental forms of clean energy. 'No-one should mistake this for anything other than a major victory for the Biden administration, which even managed to persuade a sizeable number of Republicans in the Senate and the House to vote in favor. It's exactly the type of major bipartisan win which Joe Biden promised during his campaign, and which naysayers said he would never achieve.\n\nSkittish Democrats complain Biden and his team have done too little to trumpet their successesincluding the American Rescue Act, which helped keep the economy afloat and provided lifelines to millions of Americans through stimulus checks and a landmark family tax credit projected to cut child poverty in half. 'But the Delta variant, natural disasters like Hurricane Ida, and the fallout from the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan prevented the Biden administration from finding the right opportunity to sell the legislation, along with the rest of his agenda, to the American people. 'Now, having passed another major legislative package, Biden and the Democratic Party have a second chance to make clear what they have delivered. Biden's task is to move beyond the unsightly legislative sausage-making and convert his victory into tangible signs of progress, be they roads, bridges or broadband Americans can see in their own communities.\n\nPassing the infrastructure bill counts as a significant victory for Biden. But there is still the reconciliation package -- and plenty more to be done beyond that. If the Democrats cannot offer tangible progress on the economy, the pandemic and popular social policies like paid family leave, they will likely be looking at Republican congressional majorities in 2023 and a very competitive presidential election the year after. But if they keep problem-solving, the party can beat the odds."

But the DHS Secretary doesn't have the ability to change those policies with the wave of a wand. It's unclear what the President thinks he'll be able to accomplish with a new temporary DHS secretary. Policy statements can be issued, along with executive orders, but they will all be challenged and locked up in the courts by liberal opponents. Kevin McAleenan won't be able to produce any more magic than Nielsen could. As much as I support the President's desire to strengthen the border and block the flow of illegal aliens, this seems like an unproductive move.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen's resignation Sunday as secretary of Homeland Security is best understood as a ritual sacrifice for the failures of the American political system on immigration. Ms. Nielsen wasn't responsible for the surge of Central American migrants arriving at the border to claim political asylum, but Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress both needed a fall guy. Mr. Trump's immigration strategy is failing even on his own top priority of border security. He needs to get past his fixation with the border wall and make the case to the public and Congress for bipartisan immigration solutions.\n\nThe crisis at the border could be quickly brought under control if Congress would take these necessary and common sense steps: fund the wall; provide adequate resources for detention; speed up asylum claims processing, and close the legal loopholes that allow activists and criminals to encourage flooding America with unprecedented numbers of illegal immigrants.\n\nBlaming Nielsen for the border chaos is like blaming your energy commissioner for an oil shortage brought upon by an OPEC embargo. The obvious culprit in the present border overload is the Democrats' refusal to address the asylum law loopholes that prohibit border agents from turning illegal aliens around at the border once they utter the words: 'I want asylum.  Asking Nielsen to single-handedly reverse this insane policy would be asking her to break the law.\n\nSome, however, argue that 'in government as well as the military, when disastrous defeats occur, recovery is only possible when leaders are held accountable. Sometimes that means honorable figures must lose their jobs in order for a new team to come in, clean house and then move in a more decisive manner. Nielsen's successor deserves more support from Congress as well as the White House than she received, but it won't hurt to have someone in the job who is perceived as tougher by observers on both sides of the border. In a crisis like the one we're facing at the border, Trump should keep firing people until he finds the ones who will do the job.\n\nDHS is 'a $40 billion department that employs almost a quarter of a million people, and most of them don't work on immigration issues. DHS is charged with protecting the country from terrorism, preparing for and responding to emergencies of all sorts, coordinating the federal government's cyber-security efforts, and assisting state and local law-enforcement in countless ways. The department is home to the three immigration services. but it is also home to the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Protective Service, and more. 'In considering possible replacements for Nielsen, the president and his advisers should keep in mind that the Secretary of DHS is not a kind of minister of immigration. The person in charge of that department needs to have some background or capacity for the much broader set of challenges involved in the job."

        "document": "A trove of documents brought to the attention of the Supreme Court on Thursday makes it hard to see the Trump administration's efforts to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census as anything but a partisan power grab. An accurate and fair count of everyone in America isn't just any policy goal. There's much at stake with the 2020 census---from the future of the next redistricting cycle to how billions of dollars in federal funding will be allocated. The Supreme Court should see this new evidence for what it seems to reveal: A blatant attempt to rig a constitutional mandate.\n\nThe newly revealed documents show that the Trump administration's purpose in putting the citizenship question on the upcoming census was not its stated one to help Hispanic voters under the Voting Rights Act, but rather to create policy that would be 'a disadvantage to the Democrats' and 'advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.  It's difficult to produce a greater smoking gun than explicitly saying you are hoping to help the GOP by increasing white voting power. 'Even if it is otherwise constitutionally permissible to experiment with different understandings of how to draw districts with equal populations under the equal protection clause, the government should not be able to do so if the purpose is to dilute the power of political adversaries and minority voters, as demonstrated in this case by the new revelations.\n\nLong before Trump was even elected, Republican Party insiders were plotting to increase white political power at the expense of people of color. After Trump was elected, they implemented this plan by insisting that their actual goal was the protection of minority voting rights. there was the real reason and the stated reason, the truth and the pretext. 'That the Republican effort to increase white political power might be motivated by partisanship rather than racism is little solace. Segregationist Democrats might not have insisted on disenfranchising black voters after Reconstruction had those voters not been staunch Republicans. Whether motivated by partisanship or racism, though, the result is the same. Yet the census case does not hinge on whether the citizenship question is discriminatory. Rather, as a matter of administrative law, the executive branch must follow certain procedures before making decisions. The Trump administration's blatant dishonesty settles the question of whether it followed procedure definitively: It did not.\n\nFederal law protects the privacy of everyone who responds to the census. But that's small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercounted if there is a citizenship question on the census. 'By the bureau's own, nonpartisan analysis, adding a citizenship question to the 'short form' that will go to every household in America in 2020 could result in an undercount of 6. 5 million people---close to the entire population of Indiana or Tennessee. And the agency has told Mr. Ross that there are better alternatives to a citizenship question that wouldn't pose significant 'potential quality and cost disruptions' in administering the census, such as deriving citizenship data from the American Community Survey. At the heart of the dispute lies the question: Who gets to be counted?"

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "Heading into tonight, the majority of Democrats appeared set on nominating Joe Biden. Nothing that happened tonight changed the current trajectory. Quite a few of the debates this cycle felt like frustrating wastes of time, but this one felt particularly moot. The second hour was the non-coronavirus section, and the back-and-forth exchanges about climate change, fracking bans, immigration enforcement, and abortion access felt like a historical relic. Kids may not go back to school before autumn, and the economy is about to get pummeled, which makes the issue of the temperature in a hundred years seem particularly insignificant in the here and now.\n\nBernie is, in practical terms, finished, and he plainly knows it. His clear goal in this debate, in the vein of issue and movement candidates since time immemorial, was to push his agenda on the party. Biden, though he came onstage wearing a red tie, took the bait. He bragged about his shifts to the left on abortion and immigration. He promised 'no new fracking,  committed to crackdowns on oil drilling, and pledged himself to the 'New Green Deal.  Some of those lines were delivered in gift-wrapped sound bites for the Trump campaign. All of which is why Biden, though he looked better than usual in this format, probably won't want to debate Bernie Sanders again.\n\nBiden's new position on immigration is that if he is elected, no one will be deported in his first 100 days as president. And he said a person who enters the U. S. illegally won't be deported even if the person has a criminal record in any foreign country, unless the immigrant is convicted of a felony in the U. S. That position on deportations is an extreme one that could cost Biden votes even in Hispanic communities among people who fear that new neighbors who have committed crimes elsewhere might commit crimes again in the U. S. 'Then Biden sought to appease the environmental community by pledging that there would be 'no new fracking' if he becomes president, and also said he would ban drilling for fossil fuels on public lands. Given the importance of fracking to the economies of key electoral states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Colorado, Biden is opening himself up to relentless attacks by Trump in the fall that he is anti-jobs and that he would make America dependent on imported oil and natural gas.\n\nSanders argues that if we had socialized health insurance right now, nobody would have to pay for testing or treatment for the coronavirus. That's true, and if the only alternative were a total laissez-faire healthcare system, most of the population might side with Sanders. 'Sanders wants to expand the argument from people with the coronavirus shouldn't have to pay for treatment, to people with illness or injury shouldn't have to pay for treatment. But here's the thing: It's very sensible to have targeted government-guaranteed coverage for the coronavirus and not for broken bones. For one, the coronavirus looks like a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Second, it's incredibly contagious, and thus there are large externalities, and that's the problem here. In other words, there's a strong case for government action in this specific case---it's a lot simpler than a revolution.\n\nSome argue that 'Bernie Sanders gave his best debate performance of the 2020 presidential campaign. For the first time since these exchanges began last June, the Vermont senator got angry. He also got specific. On issue after issue, from immigration to health care to student debt to foreign policy, he challenged Joe Biden's record. The former vice president rolled his eyes, quibbled, and at times simply denied his own past votes. 'Sanders' best and last pitch was his most effective, one that he should have been making explicitly for the last nine months, namely, that Biden's campaign will not inspire the country. He will have the support of the Democratic establishment and many of the party's most reliable voters. He will also likely enjoy the support of some traditional Republican voters in wealthy suburbs across the United States. But that will not necessarily translate into the only thing that really matters: taking back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all three of which will likely be necessary for Democrats to win in November."

According to the poll, Trump would barely edge out Biden among white voters, 47% to 46%. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 20 points among white voters---and this was not unheard of. Mitt Romney beat the Obama-Biden ticket by 20 points among whites in 2012, and John McCain won whites by 12 points in 2008. 'Quinnipiac also found that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , would get within eight points of Trump among white voters. Not since 1996, when Bill Clinton came within two points of Bob Dole, has any Democrat come within single digits among whites. It's just hard to see Harris having the best performance among whites in 24 years running against Trump, who has built his successful electoral career around white identity politics.\n\nWe are 17 months away from the election. At this point in the 2016 election season, polls showed Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by huge margins. An Associated Press poll published on 10/25/16, two weeks before the election, gave the race to Clinton by 13 points, the same margin that Quinnipiac gives to Biden today.\n\nIowa Democratic voters have seen and heard much more from the contenders than almost any other state, and thus are much less likely to base their preferences largely on name identification. For Biden, that hasn't been a good thing. The state's ideological lean also hampers Biden. Sixty-eight percent of 2016 Democratic caucusgoers were liberals, according to the entrance poll. That's bad news for Biden, whose national lead rests on moderate voters. There are simply many fewer potential Biden voters in the state than there are in the nation as a whole. This places organization at a premium, as it is crucial for him to turn out every last potential vote. If Biden can't win in Iowa, he's unlikely to be able to catch up later.\n\nSome argue, 'The only Democratic candidate with real national stature is former Vice President Joe Biden. But Biden has always been a weak, self-destructive candidate and he is still a weak, self-destructive candidate. From defending the Chinese, to sniffing people's hair, to plagiarizing others, there is a 'Bidenness' that plagued his first two campaigns for president and will probably destroy this one. If Biden does fade---and recent Iowa polls certainly make this possible---the Democrats will have no national candidate.\n\nOthers contend, 'Biden's decision to change his position on the Hyde Amendment is actually something abortion supporters should welcome---because it is a tribute to the power they hold. Pro-lifers loved George H. W. Bush when he flip-flopped, and just look at the behavior of evangelicals in relation to Trump on social issues. Making converts out of politicians is what activism is all about. Punishing someone for joining you is politically insane, even for people who often seem politically insane. The truth is that Biden is running a nearly perfect campaign in the early going based on one implicit message: I can beat Trump, because I can speak to his voters and I'm not a crazy socialist like some of these other folks.\n\nStill others point out that 'a recent NPR/Marist poll finds only 18 percent support third-trimester abortion. Yet every Democratic senator running for president voted against a bill requiring doctors to help infants who survive a late-term abortion. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (N. Y. ) says there's no room in the party 'for a Democratic candidate who does not support women's full reproductive freedom.  That's slamming the door on a majority of voters. 'The Democratic contenders are espousing policies few Americans support and giving moderate and conservative members of their own party the cold shoulder. Democrats eyeing the White House need to get real. By writing off moderate and conservative members of their own party, they're boosting Trump's chances of reelection. Then again, Trump's reelection may be the gut punch that brings the Democratic party back to its senses."

        "document": "Justice Gorsuch cites the High Court's Phillips (1971) ruling that held Title VII protects a woman not hired because she was a mother. But motherhood is inextricably linked to biological sex. Gender and sexual orientation are not. 'The good textualist is not a literalist,  Justice Scalia once wrote. The majority here isn't merely applying an overly broad or vague law, which Justice Gorsuch has criticized the Court for doing in other cases. The Court is redefining the original meaning of 'sex' in the law. 'If Justice Gorsuch can use textualism to rewrite a statute to comport with changing public mores, then it is meaningless. Textualism becomes merely one more tool of those who believe in a 'living Constitution' that means whatever any Justice says it means. Justice Gorsuch has defined his own jurisprudence down.\n\nFor decades, courts rightly interpreted 'sex' discrimination in Title VII as prohibiting employers from treating women worse than men because they are women and vice versa. Rewriting the law to include 'gender identity' as a protected status should be a power held solely by the legislative branch, and Congress has declined to make this change multiple times. The same is true about adding 'sexual orientation' to Title VII. Again, Congress has repeatedly rejected adding that classification to Title VII. 'This very point was recognized earlier in Zarda's litigation by Judge Gerard Lynch, an Obama appointee on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Lynch supports adding at least one LGBT classification to Title VII as a matter of policy. Yet he did not interpret the law that way, saying: 'I would be very pleased to awake to learn that Congress had secretly passed such legislation more than a half century agountil I actually woke up. Because we all know that Congress did no such thing. \n\nTo say that because sexual orientation is related to sex, it is the same thing as sex, is as nonsensical as saying that a square and a rectangle are the same thing for painting purposes because both have four sides. Laws should be interpreted according to the generally understood and understandable public meaning at the time they were adopted. Otherwise, the meaning of laws might change willy-nilly. All this is important because radically new interpretations of existing phrases can lead to unforeseen consequences. 'Alito outlined some of them in his dissent, including how this reading of 'sex' for employment purposes could also be used not just to allow but to mandate unisex locker rooms, the participation of men in women's sports leagues, and coed roommates in colleges or to make the use of an undesired personal pronoun a legally punishable offense. Gorsuch and company should never have approached this judicial Pandora's box. Implementing a social agenda, even an admirable one, is not a judge's job. As Alito wrote in his opening sentence, 'There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation. \n\nIn Harris, a funeral home had separate dress codes for men and women; a biological male (Stephens) began 'living as a woman' and was fired for dressing as a woman. Under Gorsuch's reasoning, this would qualify as sex discrimination because a woman would not be fired for dressing as a woman. But that assumes that the Court has decided whether Stephens is a woman, which of course is the entire question in debate in arguments about the legal and social status of transgenderism. 'The Harris Funeral Home enforced its dress code against Stephens not to discriminate against women dressing as women, but because it believed that Stephens was a man. Just as it did in Roe v. Wade (deciding who is a human) or Obergefell v. Hodges (deciding what is a marriage), the Court actually decided the most important question in the case without even admitting it was doing so.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of this decision, and the size of the loss to religious and social conservatives. SCOTUS, the highest legal authority in the land, has declared that homosexuality and transgenderism are like race. If you disagree, you are on the side of Klansmen, in effect. This is not just the opinion of Democratic lawmakers, or columnists at The New York Times. This is now the law of the land. And it became the law of the land thanks to two Republican nominated justices. 'The last reason. why religious conservatives should grit their teeth and vote for Trump anyway has now been blasted to smithereens by this decision written by a Trump justice. And not just a Trump justice, but the paradigmatic Trump justice, the man whose place on the Supreme Court was meant to justify religious conservatives turning a blind eye to Trump's many other failures. This is what 'but Gorsuch' means. Those words are like ashes in the mouth today."

When all the adults in a place are modeling exclusion and discrimination, kids will too. 'Whatever your views on LGBTQ rights and gender identity, barring teachers from even recognizing that gay people exist forces them to lie to their students and breaks down trust between students and educators. After all, millions of students nationwide have gay parents, siblings, friends, aunts, uncles and on and on. They watch gay celebrities on television and in movies. Many will identify as LGBTQ themselves. Barring the mention of reality doesn't make reality cease to exist.\n\nSen. Jeff Brandes (R-FL) had proposed an amendment that attempted to remove the perceived stigmatization of LGBTQ people in the bill while still meeting DeSantis' objective. His amendment banned instruction of 'human sexuality' for children in third grade and under instead of singling out sexual orientation or gender identification. It had support from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates. But his Republican colleagues voted down the amendment. LGBTQ Floridians once hoped DeSantis could be an ally. Not anymore. 'Steve Contorno, CNN\n\nRepublicans, in their eagerness to get the 'don't say gay' bill across the finish line, revived a repulsive, homophobic myth: That queer people are pedophiles who recruit children. 'The bill that liberals inaccurately call 'Don't Say Gay' would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,  Christina Pushaw, DeSantis' longtime press secretary, wrote over the weekend on Twitter. She followed up by saying that anyone who opposes the bill is 'probably a groomer.  The term 'groomer,  of course, is just another word for 'child molester,  as actual pedophiles are known to 'groom' their victims before assaulting them. But (I can't believe this needs to be said in the year 2022) there is no evidence that LGBTQ people molest children at a higher rate than straight-identified people.\n\nThese measures are rooted in the anachronistic belief that discussions about gender and sexuality somehow endanger children. But for many LGBTQ kids, schools can be an important lifeline for information---and a source of comfort that they are not alone. In a recent survey, the Trevor Project found that 42 percent of LGBTQ youths seriously considered suicide in the past year. Eliminating mention of these topics will only isolate these children further and deprive students of a chance to learn about their identities and those of their peers.
