        "document": "Mr. Biden is proposing a top federal tax rate of roughly 42%, and higher if he succeeds in his aim to raise the top rate on wages to 39. 6% from 37%. Add state taxes in Democratic enclaves and earners could pay well above 50% of what they earn to Uncle Joe. The plan is also a tacit admission that Medicare for All is a fiscal fantasy, since even current Medicare needs a giant tax increase. Imagine the rates required if Medicare covers those under age 65.\n\nThe White House proposal doesn't address any of Medicare's fundamental cost drivers, and even pretends it can rescue the program while charging seniors less. The fact sheet says the Administration will 'lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs subject to negotiation,  limit some prescription out-of-pocket costs to $2, and lower costs for mental-health visits. More subsidies mean more costs, which mean more taxes and price controls. The only good news is that this plan is a political document with no chance of passing this Congress.\n\nBiden claimed that the limited 'negotiations' in last year's massive spending bonanza will 'reduce the deficit by $159 billion.  But even when Biden's analysts originally claimed savings twice that large from price 'negotiations,  the Congressional Budget Office wrote: 'That decrease projected, but not yet realized was almost entirely offset by increases in projected outlays for other programs.\n\nBut now, Biden wants us to believe that even more government price negotiations---he wants to adopt these even before the limited test project for negotiations has had a chance to prove itself---will save yet another $200 billion. Biden is promising changes that amount to hocus pocus to achieve savings for both government and seniors that history shows will probably never materialize.\n\nThe president's implication that full benefits can be paid without raising taxes for 98 percent of families has no basis in mathematical reality. Imagine that Congress let the Trump tax cuts expire, applied Social Security taxes to all wages, doubled the top two tax brackets to 70 and 74 percent, increased investment taxes, imposed Senator Bernie Sanders's 8 percent wealth tax on assets over $10 billion and 77 percent estate tax on estates valued at more than $1 billion, and raised the corporate tax rate back to 35 percent.\n\nCombined federal income, state and payroll marginal tax rates would approach 100 percent for wealthy taxpayers, and America would face among the highest wealth, estate and corporate tax rates in the developed world. Yet total new tax revenue---4 percent of G. D. P. ---would still fall short of Social Security and Medicare shortfalls that will grow to 6 percent of G. D. P. over the next three decades. Not even halving the defense budget would close the remaining gap."

        "document": "The country needs spending on such public works as roads and bridges, and some projects will offer an economic return on the investment. But this bill throws money at far more than that, with only $110 billion reserved for this traditional infrastructure. The bill includes tens of billions in public broadband subsidies that will pre-empt private investment. Amtrak gets a $66 billion bailout. 'The Congressional Budget Office (CB0) found the bill will add $256 billion to the federal deficit over 10 years, plus another $196 billion over the 2021 budget baseline in the government's contract authority.\n\nThe federal government already spends more than enough on infrastructure to meet our needs and the COVID-19 bailout money left many states awash in cash. Despite promises, only a small portion of the bill focuses on traditional infrastructure such as fixing roads and bridges and the legislation (soon to be law) will add $256 billion to deficits. 'It will also help grease the wheels for the passage of the larger multi-trillion welfare bill that will expand Medicare and Obamacare, initiate a federal takeover of preschool and child care, and impose economically devastating tax increases on individuals and businesses. 'Biden entered this week reeling from a devastating rebuke of his presidency by voters in areas of the country thought to be reliably Democratic. He headed into the 2022 election year a wounded animal, and Republicans stood to make major gains. Now, they tossed him a life raft and allowed him to put bipartisan gloss on his radical agenda. Every Republican who voted for this monstrosity who is not already retiring should be primaried and defeated. 'Philip Klein, National ReviewOther argue, 'It's true that without the 13 Republicans, the bill would not have passed Friday night. But. there was simply no way that the progressive House members were going to allow their party to march into 2022 with absolutely nothing to show for all of their efforts. 'At best, they would have stymied the infrastructure bill until the CBO finished scoring the reconciliation package. If it was still over the limits demanded by the moderates, Biden and Pelosi would have found something to lop off to get it down to the required amount and both of the bills would have passed with no GOP support anyway. 'This legislative agenda is obviously not one that many (or any) conservatives or Republicans should be cheering for. But the reality is that the Democrats currently hold all three of the levers of power at the federal level and they were always going to try to leverage that power to further their own agenda. If we don't want that to happen, the only real solution is to be smarter, fight harder, and win more elections. Passing an actual infrastructure bill is part of the business of government and it would have to be done sooner or later."

        "document": "More than a quarter of all birds have vanished from the United States since 1970, a loss of nearly 3 billion animals. Over the past decade, 467 species were declared extinct. These extinctions were driven by habitat loss, overfishing, competition from invasive species, and climate change. 'Trees are an important bulwark against climate change, cooling the air around them, capturing and storing carbon, supporting other species, and cycling moisture. A research team last year found that helping forests recover and regenerate could soak up a large share of all the greenhouse gas emissions humanity has ever produced. Yet the world also received a shocking glimpse in the past year of how vulnerable even the mightiest forests can be. The Amazon rainforest, the world's largest tropical forest, suffered its highest rate of decline in more than a decade in 2019 driven by logging, mining, and agriculture.\n\nIt's startling to recall just how dirty America was in 1970. Rust Belt cities (which hadn't yet fully rusted) suffered air-pollution levels comparable to Beijing's in recent years; Los Angeles and smog were synonymous. The air in Mobile, Alabama, was so bad that it was costing people almost four years of their lives. So it wasn't hard to get people marching: estimates of participation in that first glorious Earth day run at twenty million, or ten per cent of the American population at the time. All that marching worked: the shift in the Zeitgeist forced Richard Nixon to sign one law after another, from the Clean Water Act to the Endangered Species Act. And those laws worked: air pollution has dropped by more than sixty per cent across America since 1970, and life expectancy has grown by 1. 5 years on average as a result. 'But after 1970, we chose to do the easy and obvious stuff, and we didn't transform our systemsor our outlooksin fundamental ways. Instead of pollution that you can see (and smell), in this century we're increasingly dealing with what the President might call an 'invisible enemy': the carbon-dioxide molecule. This time, there's no easy technical fix, just turning off the fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy. But that means turning off the giant companies that dominate the hydrocarbon economy. That's not an argument about sciencethat's a fight about power.\n\nEnvironmental writer Emma Marris states that 'It was British Petroleum that first popularized the individual carbon footprint calculator, because it really puts all of the burden and guilt about solving climate change on the individual consumer's shoulders. take the hours that you spend now feeling guilty and reallocate them to collective action. You might not change fossil fuel policy for the entire United States, but you might get a cool bike lane put in your city that encourages a lot more people to take that option to commute. It's so easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the complexities of this extremely wicked problem. And that's why we all need to do a division of labor and collective action. That's the only thing that's going to get it done.\n\nThe IRENA group's Global Renewables Outlook concludes that greater investment in green energy would improve the cumulative gross domestic product by $98 trillion by 2050 and bring with it 42 million jobs. The return on investment: $3 to $8 for every $1 invested. The report also found that the same capital would cut CO2 emissions by 70% by 2050; renewables would replace fossil fuels used for both the industrial and transport sectors.\n\nA cooler planet with more livable cities and healthier ecosystems will be in a stronger position to fight public health emergencies, especially where contagions are involved. And a better organized and funded public health system will be more equipped to address the next hurricane or flood that leaves cities and rural areas alike confronting death and disease, especially in low-income populations. Finally, with an economy in free fall, we need to put people back to work, as soon as it is safe. The U. S. clean energy industry---in companies large and small---is a smart place to focus. China has made that bet, and we should as well, if only to strengthen U. S. competitiveness."

        "document": "Democrats have proclaimed themselves 'The Resistance' and made Trump's governance as difficult as possible, exalting their political ambition to portray him as illegitimate over the country's need for a functioning government. They have slowed appointments to a crawl by forcing the Senate to take 144 cloture votes on executive-branch nominations, with all the extended debate and chewing up of Senate session days that this entails. As the Heritage Foundation's Hans von Spakovsky and John G. Malcolm point out, the Senate took only 30 such cloture votes during the first term of the preceding nine presidents combined. 'Unfortunately, the only ways to beat back such intransigence are political: If the public is outraged enough, it must punish Democrats at the ballot box; or congressional Republicans must play the kind of hardball that makes Democrats feel there is too high a price to be paid. Neither of these is very likely---and the latter is in many ways self-defeating. Nevertheless, the president has no legal basis to adjourn Congress and make recess appointments.\n\nLike ending debate, confirming a nomination can be done quickly or slowly. Unanimous consent or a voice vote do not require the presence of all senators and can take a minute or two. If the minority refuses, however, the only option is a formal recorded vote that does require the presence of all senators and takes, on average, 35 minutes or more. The Senate took 173 recorded confirmation votes on executive branch nominations during the first term of the previous five presidents, Ronald Reagan through Obama. So far, the Senate has been forced to take 179 recorded confirmation votes, and Trump's four-year term has almost nine months to go. 'This outward example of the anti-Trump 'resistance movement' has had another debilitating consequence: It has resulted in scores of qualified nominees pulling out of the process because of long delays and frustration, or otherwise good people declining to be nominated because it likely would not result in a confirmation. The Democrats' resistance tactics have hampered the work of the entire executive branch and also affected key agencies during the present coronavirus crisis.\n\nAt the same time, 'Imagine how absurd it would be if the president could force Congress to adjourn at will. He'd be able to fill vacancies with recess appointments anytime he liked, provided, I guess, that he could convince the courts that it was an 'extraordinary occasion. The Senate could willingly hand him that authority by moving to adjourn and then squabbling with the House over the duration of the adjournment, but Trump can't seize it. And if you don't like that, imagine President Joe Biden trying it and see how much you like it then. 'If Trump wants to speed things up on the Senate rubber-stamping his judges, why doesn't he call on them publicly to approve remote voting by senators? That would be politically popular and it would move the judicial conveyor belt along.\n\nAs it stands, the president first has to force a disagreement over the date of adjournment, use this unprecedented power to order adjournment, place the houses in recess, and then use the recess to trigger his authority to make unilateral appointments. Moreover, the Senate would not only have to cooperate in a scheme to nullify its own authority but it would likely have to torch long-standing rules governing things like cloture to end debate---rules designed to protect minority interests in what Senators like to call 'the world's greatest deliberative body.  That daisy-chained strategy can break easily at various critical points. None of this needs to happen. This is a dormant provision that should be left in well-earned slumber.\n\nSome, however, argue that 'We should feel no sympathy for Congress. The House pretends to be open for the sake of preventing recess appointments. Yet as things stand, because neither chamber is actually meeting in any real sense, nothing can pass. Hence the Senate is in a de facto recess. Under current rules, when legislators go home, we have a Potemkin Congress. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to cooperate, the Senate should agree to adjourn for 10 days or more. If after a few days the House refused to pass an adjournment resolution, Mr. Trump could cite the disagreement and adjourn Congress and make recess appointments."

But this is the pattern, the maddening pattern, that so many of us who are not African American can empathize with but never truly absorb. Because death by police, for black people in this country, is too often over nothing. A $20 bill. Someone selling illegal cigarettes. A cellphone or bottle of pills assumed to be a gun. 'Unarmed, yet shot. Unarmed, yet strangled. Unarmed, yet dead. George Floyd is not the first black man to die from a white cop's indifference. He's not even the first to die from a chokehold. When something unforgivable happens over and over again, what are people to do? Where does the grief and the anger go?\n\nBlack people are about twice as likely as white people to be pulled over by law enforcement for a traffic stop. Black Americans are much more likely to be arrested and charged for drug-related crimes, despite no significant disparity in how much those populations actually use narcotics. White defendants are substantially more likely than black defendants to have their most serious charge dismissed as part of a plea bargain. Even when black men and white men are convicted of the same crime, the black men can expect a prison sentence that is 20 percent longer. 'One study found black Americans were less likely to have their complaints against law enforcement officers sustained compared to complaints by white people. That was especially true for complaints of excessive force. The list could go on. But the point is made. Racial discrimination is pervasive in American criminal justice, manifesting in every step from arrest to trial to conviction and incarceration.\n\nWhen you are oppressed there is no acceptable way to fight against your oppression. You get branded 'unpatriotic' for peacefully taking a knee to protest against police brutality. You get vilified for using boycotts as a non-violent tool of resistance. You get called 'THUGS' when, after the murder of yet another unarmed black man by the police, you protest in the streets. If violent unrest isn't the answer then what is? How exactly do you go about ending police brutality and systemic racism in America?\n\nNew York police drove an SUV through a crowd of protesters in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn; by sheer good luck, no one was seriously hurt. In Atlanta, police assaulted two people in a car for no evident reason, smashing the windows, subduing the couple with Tasers and forcibly dragging them from the vehicle. In Erie, Pennsylvania, a young woman was maced and then kicked by police while she was sitting on the ground. In Salt Lake City, an officer shoved an elderly man with a cane to the street. Numerous journalists have been shot, beaten, attacked or arrested by police. 'If you want to argue that 'violence'---a term that lacks a clear definition---is always pointless and never accomplishes anything, then I would suggest that you read some history about the French Revolution or the American Revolution or the ANC under apartheid or the IRA or the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist movements of the '60s and '70s. But first of all, try to tell that one to America's cops. They don't seem to agree. 'Andrew O'Hehir, Salon\n\nThe demonstrations around the country take as their starting point that police are brutalizing citizens of color. Law-enforcement officers and agencies have two ways to respond: They can affirm that complaint with aggressive policing and overwhelming force, or they can work to show they are on the same side, against brutality.\n\nSome urge that 'We must confront the deep legacy of bigotry that leads too many black and brown and immigrant lives to be treated with callous disregard and sometimes become the victims of pure hate. But the answer does not lie in demonizing all police officers or indiscriminately destroying property. That will only spur a backlash and lead some to see moral equivalence between the two sides in the larger struggle between right and wrong. The riots in the late 1960s only succeeded in burning out inner cities and electing Richard Nixon on the back of his Southern strategy. 'We need to learn the lessons of history -- both the legacy of systemic racism and the backlash against social chaos that benefits people who practice the politics of fear and division under the name of law and order. A relatively small number of people acting in bad faith can derail a movement, delay justice and divide a nation. With a presidential election now just five months away we can't let the forces of chaos and conflict win again."

        "document": "A simple example illustrates why Gorsuch and the court were correct. Imagine an employee named Chris who never has met the employer. Chris and the employer had communicated by text and email, but never met in person or talked by phone. Chris often has referred to a husband in discussing evening or weekend plans. When Chris and the employer meet, the employer is surprised that Chris is male. The employer fires Chris, saying that he does not want to employ gay people. If Chris were female, Chris would still have the job. That, by definition, is employment discrimination because of sex.\n\nThe scope and thus the impact of this decision is hard to overstate, aside from the immediate protections it offers for 'approximately 1 million workers who identify as transgender and 7. 1 million lesbian, gay and bisexual workers'. Among other things, it will likely doom new proposed regulations from the Trump administration stripping health-care protections from transgender individuals, since it was explicitly based on Justice Alito's rejected interpretation of the language of discrimination according to sex. Politically, the fact that Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, wrote this decision could be ominous for the president.\n\nThe ruling is a bracing defeat for social conservatives, the Trump administration, and the conservative legal movement. Legal conservatives have long justified their support for Trump by citing his success at placing like-minded jurists on the federal bench, with Gorsuch as the foremost example of their victory. Monday's ruling suggests that the reliably conservative Supreme Court majority sought for so long by right-wing legal activists may not be quite as reliable as it seemsand that their moral and ethical sacrifices to pursue it may have been in vain.\n\nThis watershed ruling implicitly recognizes that rights such as gay marriage may ring hollow if one can be fired for exercising them. And it represents a historic judicial affirmation of the dignity and equality of transgender persons. 'Gorsuch simply accepts the experience and humanity of transgender people as a given, affirming their place in our society. Gorsuch does not hesitate in correctly referring to Aimee Stephens---the transgender plaintiff---as 'she.  This may seem like a simple gesture. Yet it stands as a towering rebuke of judges who have recently issued decisions that cruelly misgender transgender plaintiffs. Monday's victory is not just a triumph of textualism; it is a triumph of love and dignity.\n\nFor some time, overwhelming majorities of the American public have opposed job discrimination against LGBTQ people. According to data from the Public Religion Research Institute, not only did 72 percent of Americans in 2019 say they favored 'laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing,  that number included 61 percent of Republicans. 'All of which tells us that as a political matter, this question is pretty much settled. Of course, in theory the Supreme Court is supposed to ignore politics and simply rule on the law, but that's often not how it works---or at least, the law is only part of the story. The justices are well aware of public opinion, and while they might resist more at some times than others, they're capable of bending to political reality.\n\nSome posit that 'Justice Gorsuch's commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures---based on a wooden reading of the word 'operate. 'The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions.\n\nIn a concurring opinion in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018), Gorsuch suggested that religious conservatives should enjoy sweeping exemptions from laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. And the Supreme Court is expected to hear a case next fall asking whether religious organizations have a broad right to engage in anti-LGBTQ discrimination. So the fate of individual LGBTQ workers remains unclear---at least for employees with bosses who object to LGBTQ people on religious grounds."

The claim that the prosecutor had to wait to authorize an arrest until the investigators nailed down all the evidence is nonsense. I don't look at this as a racial issue, or a 'cops against black men' issue. It is a matter of equal protection under the law. Any civilian, regardless of race, who did what Chauvin did would have been placed under arrest. 'Investigators did not need to be sure that they could make a third-degree murder charge stick to know that some kind of prosecutable homicide happened in the killing of George Floyd. This was not a fleeting incident, or a situation in which Floyd was resisting---he was pleading for his life. At the very least, this was a negligent homicide.\n\nChauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Good: Police use of such unnecessary force is a betrayal of every good cop and of the public itself. Outrage over it is entirely righteous. But that outrage shouldn't be directed at innocents and culminate in yet more senseless violence. Another man died in Minneapolis when protests turned violent. Angry mobs set fire to a police precinct and several private businesses. 'The rioters also burned something that would've helped the community: the site of an affordable-housing project that was to provide 189 low-income apartments, including dozens of super-low-income ones.\n\nWe must distinguish rioting and looting from protesting. Look at the long-term studies done on rioting. Riots harm their communities. They don't reform them. They often initiate a general spike in violent crime. Baltimore saw this spike in the past half-decade. Riots dissuade individuals, families, and businesses from staying in or joining a community. Who wants to raise their kids in the neighborhood where the police station had to be evacuated before it was set ablaze? . George Floyd's girlfriend said, 'I am heartbroken. Waking up this morning to see Minneapolis on fire would be something that would devastate Floyd. \n\nThere is a striking pattern of evidence, teased out in the research of the Princeton political scientist Omar Wasow, showing how peaceful civil rights protests helped Democrats win white votes, and then violence pushed white voters toward Republicans. Looking at data from the civil rights era, Wasow argues that 'proximity to black-led nonviolent protests increased white Democratic vote-share whereas proximity to black-led violent protests caused substantively important declines'---enough to tip the 1968 election from Hubert Humphrey to Nixon. 'The political history of both the 1960s and the 2010s suggests a strong presumption against the political effectiveness of looting or vandalism or arson, to go along with the direct costs for the communities where riots are most likely to break out. Martin Luther King Jr. became more politically radical in his last years, but his opposition to rioting was a constant. 'Every time a riot develops,  he warned just months before his death, 'it helps George Wallace.  If we are headed for a long, hot, virus-shadowed summer, those are words that a liberalism that doesn't want to help Donald Trump would do well to keep in mind.\n\nThe national media have been insisting on the theme of the allegedly brutal Minneapolis police department. But Why are the Minneapolis police in black neighborhoods? Because that's where violent crime is happening, including shootings of two-year-olds and lethal beatings of 75-year-olds. Just as during the Obama years, the discussion of the allegedly oppressive police is being conducted in the complete absence of any recognition of street crime and the breakdown of the black family that drives it. 'Once the violence began, any effort to 'understand' it should have stopped, since that understanding is inevitably exculpatory. The looters are not grieving over the stomach-churning arrest and death of George Floyd; they are having the time of their lives. You don't protest or mourn a victim by stealing oxycontin, electronics, jewelry, and sneakers.\n\nSome urge that 'we as Americans can't let the smoke obscure the very real issues we must confront. We can't ignore the issues of inequality in this country. No one can claim with a straight face that black and brown kids in the inner cities get an education equal to what kids in the suburbs receive. No one can deny that minorities find themselves on the wrong end of our justice system in unequal numbers. No one with a heart can watch these murders and not feel deep sadness, anger, and even guilt."

        "stance": "left",
        "document": "President Trump has regularly and repeatedly suggested that America is not the country of American Jews. Israel is 'your country,  he says, and Netanyahu is 'your prime minister'. Just a few days ago, Trump proffered a cavalcade of anti-Semitic stereotypes in a speech before the Israeli American Council, lambasting American Jews for their insufficient love of both him and Israel, calling Jews 'not nice people' who would nonetheless be compelled to vote Republican in order to protect their wealth. 'That the same administration that has cried about 'free speech on campus' when it comes to protecting the rights of racist provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos is suddenly a lot more invested in student safety when it might help suppress pro-Palestinian protests provokes fears that it primarily sees the charge of anti-Semitism as a tool to bludgeon wayward Democrats.\n\nThe draft text suggests concerns about treating Jews as non-Americans were overblown. But is also is a sign that the Trump administration might be willing to expand ongoing efforts to attack the speech rights of Palestinian campuses on campus, an extension of an illiberal trend in organized pro-Israel advocacy that should trouble all of us. 'The Trump Department of Education has already launched several investigations into pro-Palestinian campus speech under the auspices of Title VI. It's possible this could escalate after the executive order. 'In the last year alone, the Department of Education has launched investigations into alleged anti-Semitism at Rutgers University, Duke University, the University of North Carolina, and Williams College. If found to have enabled anti-Semitism on campus, these universities could forfeit millions of dollars in federal funding. Yet, in each case, the 'anti-Semitic' speech being investigated is criticism of Israel. \n\nMr. Trump's executive order points agencies to the definition of anti-Semitism prepared by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. This definition includes several examples of speech that should be covered by the First Amendment, like 'claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.  For this reason Kenneth Stern, the lead author of the definition, wrote in The Times that it shouldn't be applied to higher education. The agency's definition was prepared for data collectors writing reports in Europe, not for government officials policing campus speech.\n\nSome, however, note that 'The order only directs agencies to consider the IHRA's list 'to the extent that any examples might be useful as evidence of discriminatory intent.  In other words, applying double standards to Israel alone would not trigger a Title VI investigation. Instead, the IHRA's list would only come into play after an individual is accused of overt anti-Semitism with an ethnic component, and then only as evidence of bigoted intent. 'In fact, it's unclear whether Wednesday's order will have any impact, given that it mostly just reaffirms the current law. It restates the federal government's long-standing interpretation of Title VI to encompass some anti-Jewish bias. And it raises the faint possibility that, in some case down the road, a student's sharp criticism of Israel may be used as evidence of anti-Semitic intent after he has been accused of targeting Jews because of their perceived race or nationality. Is this order red meat for Republicans who believe colleges are increasingly hostile to Jews? Probably. Will it quash the pro-Palestine movement on campuses or impose an unwanted classification on American Jews? Absolutely not."

Russian cluster bomb attacks have damaged homes, hospitals, and schools, and killed more than 58 civilians at a crowded train station in April 2022. The unexploded ordnanceplus unmarked landmines across swaths of Ukrainian territorywill require expensive cleanup even without additional cluster munition supplies.\n\nIn a perfect world, we would ban all munitions. Differences between nations could be settled in a court or on a soccer field. But that world doesn't exist. A nation so pointlessly attacked as Ukraine should be able to do everything to defend itself. Americans would likely consider doing the same if we were attacked.\n\nOne nation, and one nation only, gets to determine whether to use cluster munitions on its land---Ukraine. Its interest in using these controversial weapons is to destroy the Russian invaders while minimizing the loss of its own citizens' lives. It will likely be as judicious as possible while inflicting as much damage on the enemy as possible. And Ukraine's defense minister has vowed not to use the munitions in Russia. Yes, Kyiv will live with the scars of war, but ultimately, these munitions will save Ukrainian lives.\n\nSome argue, 'the American response to Ukraine is entirely out of proportion for a country long acknowledged not to implicate core U. S. interests. It's also potentially catastrophic: Gradually escalating is all fun and games until a nose-bloodied and humiliated Putin lobs the first tactical nuke in Ukraine or launches a massive conventional strike on, say, Poland, and then the world as we know it comes to an end.\n\nAs the Biden administration conceded recently, one reason Washington is turning to gruesome cluster munitions to bolster Kiev is that America's military-industrial base isn't keeping up with the war's demandsitself a symptom of a generational, bipartisan abandonment of U. S. manufacturing. If the 'pittance' of a war in Ukraine is stretching the Pentagon's conventional stockpiles, imagine the industrial incapacity that a confrontation with China over Taiwan might reveal."

Yet some of the most critical positions in the government---including the secretary and deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security---remain without a confirmed official in place to this day not because of Senate dawdling but because the president hasn't gotten around to making a selection. Indeed, Trump has said that he likes having senior roles in government filled by acting officials, who may be more eager to please him. In the middle of a pandemic and with the economy in a tailspin, it is a dereliction of presidential duty to have left the government so woefully understaffed.\n\nMoreover, 'Despite Trump's claim that he has a 'very strong power' to adjourn Congress, this power is actually quite limited. The Constitution provides that the president may adjourn both houses of Congress 'to such Time as he shall think proper,  but only 'in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.  Thus, the president's power to adjourn Congress is only triggered when the two houses disagree about when to adjourn. right now the House and Senate are in agreement about when to adjourn---they plan to formally adjourn on January 3, 2021. 'All of that said, if McConnell were determined to engineer a situation where Trump could make recess appointments, he could most likely do so. Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that Trump succeeds in adjourning the Senate. Then what? The most likely answer is that Trump would have to keep Congress out of session for a decent amount of time. Democratic political operatives couldn't dream of a more damaging story to tell about Trump during a presidential election year. The president is threatening to delay stimulus legislation, relief for many people who are unemployed, and potentially funding for necessary public health measures, over a petty dispute about a few political job vacancies.\n\nThe Senate is holding formal sessions every few days. Those formal sessions mean that the Senate is not in recess and that President Trump cannot use the recess-appointment power to unilaterally make appointments. This, by the way, is exactly what the Senate did during President Barack Obama's term to prevent him from making his own recess appointments. And in 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the Senate's power to do that. 'All this talk of adjournments and recesses may sound technical. But many important principles of constitutional law are embodied in constitutional fine print. Most obviously, a president cannot just make Congress disappear when he wishesin order to end an oversight investigation, for instance, or to prevent Congress from voting against a war he would like to wage. As for the question of staffing the government, the Supreme Court explained in its 2014 decision that the primary method prescribed by the Constitution for appointing officers of the United Statesincluding the attorney general, Supreme Court justices, and more than 1, 000 other varied jobsis presidential nomination plus Senate confirmation. The president generally can't just cut Congress out of the picture."
