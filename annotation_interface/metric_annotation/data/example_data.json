It has expressed no remorse for what it did, nor even the slightest indication that it would not do the same again in the future, or worse. Its spokespeople and allies continue to call for the destruction of Israel. Whether or not it is possible to reach a diplomatically negotiated political solution of the Palestinian issues (either generally or specific to Gaza), the first precondition for negotiation is that Hamas must be removed from power. That, under current conditions, can only be done by force.",

This is most clearly highlighted within the excerpts in the final sentences."

            "document": "Before Proposition 209 was passed, African American students at the University of California Berkeley made up between 6 and 7 percent of the freshman class, according to the Wall Street Journal. After the measure passed, African American students made up around 3 percent of the freshman population for the past decade, while being 6 percent of the state's public high school graduates. Latinos make up about 54 percent of the public high school seniors in the state but are only 15 percent of Berkeley's freshman class. This has had long-term ramifications, according to a recent UC Berkeley study. Since underrepresented minorities ended up attending lower-quality public and private universities, they experienced an overall decline in wages of 5 percent annually between ages 24 and 34. Overall, the study found that the ban on affirmative action has exacerbated socioeconomic inequities.\n\nCalifornia is one of just eight states that don't allow public affirmative action programs. The campaign's narrow focus on the University of California system missed the larger damage wrought by Proposition 209. The affirmative action ban halted efforts by state and local governments to give preference in hiring and contracting to underrepresented groups. Businesses owned by women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups often lack the same access to capital and connections as other firms. Americans like to believe that this country is a meritocracy, where anyone can excel with sufficient grit and tenacity. But that ignores the institutional racism baked into our society that disadvantages people of color. It ignores the systemic inequities that we are seeing play out in front of our own eyes, in the killing of George Floyd and other Black people by police and in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately hit Black and Latino families. Proposition 16 wouldn't have magically ended racial inequality in California, but it would have given the state's institutions a valuable tool to address it.\n\nIn a nation where many still deny the impacts of systemic racism and economic inequality, it's always going to be hard to persuade a majority to make even a small sacrifice to address those issues. That likely goes double during a record-setting economic downturn: Hard times rarely inspire generosity but instead a determined insistence on looking out for No. 1. The stereotype of the progressive Californian can't compensate for that.\n\nEndorsements for Prop 16 came from Newsom; Democrats who represent California in the U.S. House and Senate; the mayors of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego; the Bay Area's professional sports franchises; Facebook; Wells Fargo; Uber; United Airlines; the University of California Board of Regents; leading editorial boards and major public employee unions. Yet instead of securing passage, this unified stance of the state's institutional leadership mainly exposed a gap between elite opinion and public opinion. California may have foreshadowed the end of affirmative action.\n\nRegarding the Harvard case, in its 104-page ruling, the two-judge panel said SFFA hadn't presented a single Asian-American applicant who claimed Harvard discriminated against them. To the contrary, the court pointed out that several former and current students -- including some Asian-American students -- testified in favor of race-conscious admissions at the trial. Still, the legal battle, which comes amid a fraught national reckoning on race, is far from over.",

            "annotation": "In our first pass, we can deduce that the document is in favor of affirmative action.\nIn our second pass, we will carefully read each article to identify the main arguments that support affirmative action.\n\n<blockquote margin-top: 0px;\">\n  <span style=\"background-color: #c8ffc8;\">\n  the ban on affirmative action has exacerbated socioeconomic inequities\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nThe first article argues that abolishing affirmative action causes underrepresented communities to attend lower-quality universities, which in turn leads to lower post-graduation earnings and widens financial inequality. \nThis point is most clearly emphasized in the sentence above, which directly asserts the effect of affirmative action on such inequalities. \nHence, we highlight this to be the excerpt that best represents the article.\n\n<blockquote margin-top: 0px;\">\n  <span style=\"background-color: #c8ffc8;\">\n  Proposition 16 wouldn't have magically ended racial inequality in California, but it would have given the state's institutions a valuable tool to address it\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nThe second article supports affirmative action.\nIts main argument is that the ban on affirmative action through Proposition 209 in California has harmed underrepresented groups in areas such as university admissions, public hiring, and contracting. \nThe article also highlights the presence of systemic racial inequalities and that Proposition 16 is a step toward addressing this, though it will not completely eliminate racial inequality.\nThus, the central assertion of the article is to reinstate Proposition 16.\n<br><br>\nThe third and fourth articles note the challenges of closing the gap for underrepresented groups.\n\n<blockquote margin-top: 0px;\">\n  <span style=\"background-color: #ffc8c8;\">\n  In a nation where many... \n  </span> \n  <span style=\"color:gray\">(article abbreviated)</span>\n  <span style=\"background-color: #ffc8c8;\">\n  ...California can't compensate for that.\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nThe third article expresses skepticism about the willingness of the majority to support measures like affirmative action that require personal or societal sacrifices. \n<blockquote>\n  <span style=\"background-color: #ffc8c8;\">\n  Endorsements for Prop 16 came from Newsom...</span> \n  <span style=\"color:gray\">(article abbreviated)</span>\n  <span style=\"background-color: #ffc8c8;\">...end of affirmative action.\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nSimilarly, the fourth article discusses the increasing resistance to affirmative action among voters, despite strong support from elites.\n\nBoth articles do not explicitly advocate for the establishment of affirmative action but instead emphasize the difficulties in advancing it. As a result, we cannot find any arguments in these articles that directly support affirmative action, so we highlight both in red.\n\n<blockquote margin-top: 0px;\">\n  <span style=\"background-color: #c8ffc8;\">\n  the court pointed out that several former and current students -- including some Asian-American students -- testified in favor of race-conscious admissions at the trial\n  </span>\n</blockquote>\nThe final article's tone clearly supports affirmative action. \nThe court's ruling underscores the lack of evidence by SFFA (Students for Fair Admissions) to prove discrimination against Asian-American applicants and highlights that several Asian-American students testified in favor of affirmative action, suggesting that some members of the group purportedly disadvantaged by the policy actually support it.<br>"
