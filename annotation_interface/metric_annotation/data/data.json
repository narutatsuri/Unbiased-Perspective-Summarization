        "document": "Reports that President Donald Trump wants to send 5, 000 more troops to the Southern border, at first, come as a shock. It's a startlingly high number. To put it in perspective, NATO recently deployed 4, 500 troops in the Baltic nations to deter and repel a Russian tank assault. How many troops could possibly be needed to stave off an unarmed caravan of refugees walking up through Mexico? \nAccording to former Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, this is 'a misuse of active duty military. . . To say this isn't a political stunt is misleading the public.\nThe Trump administration has produced no evidence to support the president's repeated claims that criminals are in the caravan. . . Moreover Trump's claim that 'you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process' does not make sense. Many of the caravan members plan to request asylum, which requires that a person already be in the United States. \nNo doubt some of the caravan members will weigh the odds and decide they have a better chance of sneaking over illegally. But if even a few thousand were to try it, they would pose no unusual challenge to the Border Patrol---which apprehended nearly 6, 000 people every week last year crossing from Mexico. . . 'It's worth noting that while data specifically on refugees and those granted asylum are hard to come by. . . the New American Economy Research Fund looked at the 10 cities with the highest rates of refugee arrivals and found that 'nine out of 10 of the communities actually became considerably more safe, both in terms of their levels of violent and property crime'.\nSome posit that 'the United States has sabotaged itself. The migration crisis stems not from foreign nations duping the United States but rather from American economic development policies. . . that have exacerbated the poverty, despair and violence such policies were supposed to alleviate. \nOthers ask, 'What do we do when the caravan gets here? And more saliently: What do we do if many more caravans show up behind it? . . . This is not a passing crisis. It is the new normal, and its optics do nothing but intensify the cultural panic that is turning much of the West to authoritarianism as a response. . . Democrats can't keep dodging immigration as a real issue."

        "document": "The caravan represents a rebuke to any American claim that its borders are inviolable. . . liberals like to point out that we've seen a nearly 75 percent decline in arrests of illegals at the border since 2000, when some 1. 6 million were detained. True. But that still represents nearly 420, 000 a year. . . 'Most of the coverage from the elite media reflects the reality that many elites simply don't see a problem here. And anybody who does is violating the norms of political discourse, as established and enforced by the elites.\nWe do not have the capacity to provide safe haven to every poor person in the world, but we can (for now at least) protect our own citizens. . . quoting the preamble, the Constitution was established to 'secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,  not for the entire world.\nThis week the Mexican government offered the travelers refuge, supplies and the opportunity for permanent residency in two southern states if they applied for asylum. While hundreds of the Hondurans took them up on the offer, thousands more took a vote and decided once again to reject the plan. . . there's no reason the vast majority of them couldn't remain in Mexico. \nA 'reasonable inference is that the migrants are motivated not by a desire to escape persecution and violence, but by a desire to participate in the American economy. . . from the U. S. perspective, the desire of migrants to improve their economic status provides no legal or moral imperative for permitting entry. \nSome ask, 'How about a legal framework that considers border invasion the serious crime it should be? If the migrant caravan members not only understand they aren't welcome, but that they will actually be prosecuted under a statute that, if convicted, requires a penalty far more serious than a slap on the wrist, perhaps that Mexican asylum offer wouldn't seem so unreasonable by comparison. \nWill trying to stop the caravan work? Maybe, maybe not, but the point is to show an executive acting like an executive in defending the country's borders. Contrast this to the lack of effective action that took place during the 'children's caravans' a few years back in the Obama administration. The conventional wisdom was that it was impossible to secure the border against unwanted intrusions. . . but voters wondered why no one was even bothering to try to secure the border."

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "Critics have pejoratively described the bill as 'censorship,  but it is perfectly appropriate to censor adult themes and ideas around small children. Beyond teaching the acceptance of differences, why confuse children under eight years old, most of whom do not yet understand the biology of sexual reproduction? What need is there for schools to introduce young children to the highly contentious metaphysical claim that your sexed body may not be your 'true' gender? If parents wish to discuss these themes with their children, they are of course free to do so. 'These are not hypothetical concerns. In November, the Littlejohn family filed a lawsuit against Leon County School Board in federal district court in Northern Florida, after they were excluded from welfare decisions regarding their 13-year-old daughter. The Littlejohns had informed the school that their daughter was confused about her gender and made clear that they did not consent to social transition. 'However, it later transpired that school staff had held private meetings with her, asking which pronouns she would prefer, which restrooms she would like to use, whether she would like to stay with the boys on overnight trips, and whether they should keep her parents in the dark.\nMany parents believe that classroom teachers should not show young, impressionable children pictures that depict breast-binding or encourage physically altering their growing bodies. They don't want children in early elementary grades to read books or use gender-coloring books encouraging them to disassociate their minds from their bodies, and to focus on sex and sexuality at such a young age. 'Young children don't need to be shown a Blue's Clues Pride Parade video celebrating transgenderism and pansexuality, or Queer Kid Stuff videos that train them to ask people for their pronouns, or be told that doctors are sometimes wrong when 'assigning gender.  Children should not be instructed that there is no such thing as girls and boys. Lest this sound like an unlikely scenario: a lawsuit is being filed by a Canadian mother whose six-year-old daughter was taught 'girls are not real, and boys are not real' at school. It's more than understandable that parents have asked legislators to curb such gender-ideology activism in schools. \nNo one wants a child to feel 'not valued' or conform to one point of view. The problem is that progressives think their point of view is the only one and everyone else agrees. Otherwise opponents are labeled as homophobic or anti-LGBTQ. What Republicans are pushing for, though, is allowing young children to just be children. 'The teacher can monitor a student-led discussion on LGBTQ issues, should a child bring it up in class, but it will not be allowed to be a routine part of a class's curriculum. A young child may bring up that he or she has two moms, for example, and that can start a conversation in a classroom. It's important that it is an age appropriate discussion. The bill is a simple acknowledgement that very young children should not have to learn about mature topics in early elementary school years."

        "document": "When children come from non-traditional families, they need to be seen and recognized, not treated as so weird and deviant that their parents' relationship is unspeakable in school. When all the adults in a place are modeling exclusion and discrimination, kids will too. 'Whatever your views on LGBTQ rights and gender identity, barring teachers from even recognizing that gay people exist forces them to lie to their students and breaks down trust between students and educators. After all, millions of students nationwide have gay parents, siblings, friends, aunts, uncles and on and on. They watch gay celebrities on television and in movies. Many will identify as LGBTQ themselves. Barring the mention of reality doesn't make reality cease to exist.\nSen. Jeff Brandes (R-FL) had proposed an amendment that attempted to remove the perceived stigmatization of LGBTQ people in the bill while still meeting DeSantis' objective. His amendment banned instruction of 'human sexuality' for children in third grade and under instead of singling out sexual orientation or gender identification. It had support from Democrats and LGBTQ advocates. But his Republican colleagues voted down the amendment. LGBTQ Floridians once hoped DeSantis could be an ally. Not anymore. 'Steve Contorno, CNN\nRepublicans, in their eagerness to get the 'don't say gay' bill across the finish line, revived a repulsive, homophobic myth: That queer people are pedophiles who recruit children. 'The bill that liberals inaccurately call 'Don't Say Gay' would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,  Christina Pushaw, DeSantis' longtime press secretary, wrote over the weekend on Twitter. She followed up by saying that anyone who opposes the bill is 'probably a groomer.  The term 'groomer,  of course, is just another word for 'child molester,  as actual pedophiles are known to 'groom' their victims before assaulting them. But (I can't believe this needs to be said in the year 2022) there is no evidence that LGBTQ people molest children at a higher rate than straight-identified people.\nThese measures are rooted in the anachronistic belief that discussions about gender and sexuality somehow endanger children. But for many LGBTQ kids, schools can be an important lifeline for information---and a source of comfort that they are not alone. In a recent survey, the Trevor Project found that 42 percent of LGBTQ youths seriously considered suicide in the past year. Eliminating mention of these topics will only isolate these children further and deprive students of a chance to learn about their identities and those of their peers. 'Proponents of such bills routinely invoke the bogeyman of school systems infringing on 'parental rights,  arguing that such conversations should be led by parents and families. Of course, parents have an important role to play, and educators should generally be mindful of parental concerns. These bills, however, are an intrusive attempt to restrict speech in schools. And just like efforts against the specter of critical race theory, they seek to expunge important truths about our history and world from classrooms."

        "document": "LGBTQ+ families, including mine, have been dusting off our living wills and seeking legal advice to ensure we are as protected as we can possibly be in the event that our marriages are dissolved. Will we need to carry our adoption papers when we go to the grocery store? Our living wills when we go to see the Grand Canyon? Will we have to go back to filing separate state and federal taxes, forced by the legal system to deny the existence of our relationship in order to complete our required paperwork? .\nWhat's more, how will our child be treated as the kid of two moms in a country that is dismantling the careful framework we've built to support the changing landscape and dynamics of what it means to love, to grow a family, to support one another? Will our family be turned away, torn apart, bullied or worse? If those in charge are allowed to pick on us, to treat us as less than, what message does that send to my child's classmates? My bosses? To strangers we pass on the street? What might a future look like where our family is no longer recognized?\nCongress exercises its constitutional authority to command nationwide uniformity under the full faith and credit clause. So, for instance, Congress has ordered every state to grant full faith and credit to a custody determination and child support order issued by another state. It took this step to prevent parents from kidnapping their children by absconding to a different state and relitigating a custody order against them. The proposed law similarly appears to protect same-sex couples' parentage rights over their own children.\nMany states only acknowledge these rights because of Obergefell, which compelled them to give same-sex parents the same 'constellation of benefits' afforded to opposite-sex parents. So, for instance, a state must place both parents' names on their child's birth certificate and afford both parents the presumption of parentage; they cannot force one parent to 'adopt' a child conceived through assisted reproductive technology. Put simply, the RFMA creates a backstop to ensure that every same-sex couple can retain protections after Obergefell's demise if their own state nullifies their marriage.\nRight-wing commentators and politicians will say that Obergefell is 'settled law' and point to Justice Samuel Alito's reassurance that the court will not use the same logic they used in Dobbs to overturn Roe v. Wade as if everyone who supports marriage equality just fell off a catering truck full of gay wedding cakes. Please. Every justice on the court said that Roe was 'settled law' in their confirmation hearing and Alito's comment had Roberts and Kavanaugh, the two conservatives who pass for institutionalists, written all over it. It's obvious which way the wind is blowing and everyone knows it.\nThere might not be an immediate threat to Obergefell, but millions of LGBTQ Americans fear their hard-won right to marry whomever they love could at some point be taken away. This bill would relieve that uncertainty and enshrine their rights in the future. More than 70 percent say same-sex marriage should be recognized, according to a Gallup poll, up from 27 percent in 1996. This includes 55 percent of Republicans. Passing the Respect for Marriage Act would be politically popular. It would also be the moral, just thing to do."

        "document": "We do not deny that committed same-sex relationships can and often do have much of great value: affection, mutual caregiving, love. Some same-sex relationships clearly exceed some opposite-sex ones in these important measures. But marriage as an institution, including its governmental dimension, does not exist to award certificates of worthiness on loving relationships. Love needs no license from the state.\nThe reason marriage was considered the union of one man and one woman until just yesterday is because such unions, and only such unions, often produce children. The law never took a purely instrumental view of marriage, one that regards it as worthwhile only insofar as it yields children. But it did regard it as oriented toward child-rearing.\nIt aimed, in a way that grew less coercive over time, to encourage adults to arrange their lives so that as many children as possible are raised and nurtured by their biological parents in a common household. Same-sex marriage was not the first step away from this model of marriage. Many social trends and legal developments have weakened the links between sex, marriage, and child-rearing. But that weakening has generally been regrettable rather than laudable. Republicans should reject the bill.\nTo disconnect marriage from a transcendent obligation to children, and to make it rather an expression of individual romantic feelings, is to fundamentally alter its character. Straight people did that before gay people ever started asking for marriage rights. Nevertheless, people like me correctly understood from the beginning that same-sex marriage was a Rubicon moment in advancing the Sexual Revolution. However strained the connection between marriage and its traditional purposes was under post-1960s cultural change, there was still the possibility of reform. With the normalization of same-sex marriage, that ended.\nBut 'The reality is that there is currently one vote on the Supreme Court to revisit Obergefell, which we know because Justice Clarence Thomas was the only one on the Court who signed on to the idea of revisiting it.\nThat's because overturning it would raise issues that striking down Roe did not. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in decisions in both Casey and Dobbs, 'reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.  In contrast, the reliance interests arguments are much stronger when it comes to Obergefell given that same-sex couples have already been making lifetime commitments for years based on the outcome of the decision. Unraveling the ruling is simply not tenable.\nSome argue, 'The issue, at least as I see it, has always been whether or not the government at any level should assume for itself the power to demand a permission slip (in the form of a license) and levy a tax (even if you call it a fee) for any two consenting adults to hold a private ceremony in front of friends and family that impacts not one other human being in the country and causes no harm. We should strike the word 'marriage' from the entire tax code. We should also repeal almost every law with the word marriage in it."

        "document": "Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. 'A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn't changed since late April. More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.\nAlthough the true number of unemployed people is a matter of debate, the data show that as many as 27. 5 percent of Americans lost their job or had their hours scaled back as a result of the shutdowns. That's more than 30 million Americans, at a minimum, who were hit hard economically. We simply cannot sustain that level of economic catastrophe much longer. 'Rises in the coronavirus infection and hospitalization rates have to be put into context. We must minimize the potential loss of life, but public health measures must also be weighed against the cost of millions of ruined lives. Keeping the economy closed and the lockdowns tight would be fatal to America itself. To do this would be the public health equivalent of the famous quote from a dispatch during the Vietnam War: 'It was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it. \nMaximum lockdowns were never a realistic long-term option. The end of our patience was never going to coincide with the end of the pandemic. Yes, warmer weather will probably help some, along with more Americans spending more time outdoors. In some parts of the country, lots of people are still wearing masks; in other parts of the country, not so much. Ending idiotic policies about returning still-contagious patients to nursing homes will help reduce the death rate considerably. 'But. the virus is still out there. The fact that people would rather play out an American version of China's Cultural Revolution, complete with public 'struggle sessions,  or go over footage of a cop shoving a senior citizen in Buffalo like it's the Zapruder film, or remove the television show Cops from the airwaves---because having camera crews ride along with police officers is somehow enabling police brutality---does not change any facts about the virus and its spread.\nThe coronavirus has not disappeared, and the rules governing our response to it are still being applied to businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations. In Maryland, for example, outdoor religious services have been banned completely by Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich. And my church in northern Virginia has decided to hold off on in-person services, outdoors or indoors, because the regulations are too vague and too difficult to navigate. Where were these regulations during Saturday's protest? . 'Government officials cannot selectively restrict constitutional rights. Either the law applies to everyone, or it doesn't apply at all. In other words, if protesters have the right to gather, churches should have that right as well. Any other application of the law is hypocritical and unconstitutional.\nWith coronavirus, government has been aggressive to excessive. When business owners have attempted to reopen ahead of government timelines, many have faced harsh responses. Government actions and reactions have been aimed at normal activities by otherwise law-abiding citizens. Meanwhile, government has been permissive to passive (at least initially) with protests. Here, government action has not been taken against people gathering en masse in violation of health orders, even when some of those protests turned to violent riots. 'The danger Democrats increasingly face is that Middle America and moderate voters will see these increasingly stark juxtapositions. Democrats need protests to end now---yesterday actually. The longer they last, the worse Democrats look, and the greater the likelihood that Middle America and moderate voters make a connection from current chaos, to coronavirus, to leftward campaign content---and break with Democrats."

But what's so concerning is that the positive test rate is also increasing at the same time, up from less than 8 percent at the end of May to nearly 14 percent now. It is difficult to ignore that the places seeing surges in Covid-19 cases began to reopen businesses and other public spaces a few weeks ago. 'The nationwide protests over George Floyd's death, police violence, and structural racism have also been met with concerns that they would become superspreading events. According to the experts I spoke with, however, it is simply too early to know whether the coronavirus will spread widely because of the protests. And it is worth remembering the differences between outdoor and indoor exposure, the latter being much more dangerous; it could end up being the case that people got infected because they were arrested and put into a police van or jail cell with other people, not because they were outside protesting in a big crowd.\nSome argue that 'I've been a vocal supporter of these protests from their start. But what we should not tolerate, and what the scientific community cannot permit if it is to retain its credibility, is the abuse and manipulation of health expertise for political ends. One of two things is true; either 1) these protests will lead to a significant spike in coronavirus infections and deaths, in which case public health experts should reconcile that outcome with how they could have encouraged and endorsed them; or 2) it will not lead to such a spike, in which case it will appear that the months of extreme, draconian lockdowns---which caused great suffering and deprivation around the world---were excessive, misguided and unwarranted.\nOthers note that 'The people who are marching in the streets right now are well aware of the risk of coronavirus transmission. They are not acting out of ignorance that needs to be corrected by public-health experts. As one protester in Minneapolis said, 'Yes, corona is happening. It's real, it's deadly. But racism kills way more lives'. Even if public-health experts did want to stop the protests, they almost certainly could not. Any public-health pronouncements to the hundreds of thousands of people marching around the U. S. and worldwide would be like shouting into a mighty wind. 'Many experts, and some public-health officials, have adopted a harm-reduction approach to the protests, accepting that they must happen and offering recommendations to help people protest as safely as possible. Others have gone further by handing out masks and other protective gear on-site. The decision reflects what public-health experts have always tried to do: maximize the health of the population across all aspects of life.\nExperts never said that eternal lockdowns were the only choice we had to combat the pandemic. They argued that once areas got the initial case spikes under control through widespread social distancing (with new cases decreasing over at least a two-week span), a new phase of control should begin with widespread testing and contact tracing. The initial lockdown period avoided the worst possible scenario, but the US didn't use that time to prepare for managing the pandemic in the future. And now we've wasted the weeks that have passed since reopening. 'We managed to disrupt our economy and skyrocket unemployment, and we didn't control the damn virus,  said Jeff Shaman, an infectious disease modeler at Columbia University.\nOur current vaccine production infrastructure is already strained and. . . building new infrastructure is both expensive and complicated. It costs anywhere from $50 to $700 million to build a new facility and takes years to complete. Existing production facilities are highly specialized for making a single, specific type of vaccine, like polio or measles, and they are currently reserved to make those vaccines. If those facilities are repurposed to make a new COVID-19 vaccine, it will put the supply of other critical vaccines at risk. 'In addition, shortages of supplies like syringes and vials could delay the delivery of current vaccines and a future COVID-19 vaccine. Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that there are only 200 million vials left in the world because they've all been bought up. Operation Warp Speed is a fantastic goal. It needs a plan to match it."

Unless Mr. McCarthy is willing to rely on Democratic votes when the good of the country depends on it, we fear the House is going to be a scary place for the next two years.\nOne way out lies not with Mr. McCarthy but with individual members who get fed up with dysfunction. They can use more discharge petitions to force votes on bills that stand to attract majority support---if they could get onto the floor. With such a closely divided House, a handful of moderate Republicans could work with Democrats to circumvent the Rules Committee and GOP leadership to bring bipartisan measures to the floor.\nIn campaigning for the 2022 midterm elections, the G.

The Right showed the way here. Not in the demands it made---most of those are specific to its own agenda of taking an ax to the federal government---but in how it made them.

Many Republicans did not want the Pelosi model of an all-powerful speaker. For these members, the agreement with McCarthy is a type of Magna Carta.\nI have worked in the House in various roles since I was a House leadership page in the 1970s and, much later, represented the House in litigation. I've watched the body become less transparent, less deliberative, with every passing year. Today's legislative system is a mockery of the deliberative process, characterized by runaway spending, blind voting and perfunctory debates. You can dislike or denounce the holdouts while still admitting they have a point---Congress has got to change.\nThe House now will supposedly vote on all twelve individual appropriations bills and require 72 hours for members to review bills, provisions aimed at ending the horror-show 'omnibus' spending bills routinely presented as 'must pass' legislation hard against some deadline or holiday. McCarthy also agreed that fiscal year 2024 domestic discretionary spending won't be higher than it was in fiscal year 2022.\nChip Roy pushed for many of these changes and has a compelling vision for how a House should work with more power for the rank-and-file, all toward his goal of reducing federal spending. He played a commendable role in the speaker fight over the last week and, importantly, was willing to take 'yes' for an answer.\nUnfortunately, the divisions displayed this week make it look pretty unlikely the tiny Republican majority will be able to pull off most of the goals that the holdouts and the regulars agree on. It's not remotely clear that 218 (of just 222) House Republicans can agree on any given spending bill: The hard-liners want major cuts, immediately; at least a few moderates won't go along. 'Maybe McCarthy and his leadership team can scrape up a few Democratic votes for a budget that keeps spending growth nearly flat, though the new rules guarantee that'll be a huge slog rife with challenges that force votes on ousting the speaker. Some see the need to raise the federal debt ceiling as a prime opportunity to force some fiscal discipline. Maybe so, but that'll still require GOP unity on some less-than-ideal proposal---because if the standoff goes on too long, 'soft' Republicans will break and force some deal that protects their interests."

Yes, sure, fine, you can find nutty conspiracy theories, personal attacks, and unhinged demonization of Fauci, just as you can find that phenomenon of just about any public figure who has been venerated to the point of prayer candle merchandising. But has it ever crossed the minds of the team at Politico that maybe, just maybe, Fauci has earned some fair criticism? . 'Is it even remotely conceivable that significant swaths of the public are starting to get the sense that Fauci has been shading the truth and tweaking and tailoring his advice, sometimes in the face of well-reasoned opposition, for a long while now? Nothing Fauci's done earned him some criticism? Not even his reversal on masks? Nothing in his emails, suggesting a symbiotic relationship with adoring reporters? Nothing in his evasive answers about whether U. S. taxpayer money ended up financing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology? Nothing in Fauci's past defenses of gain-of-function research?\nAnthony Fauci's email correspondence from the early days of the pandemic have ignited a spate of recriminations over masks and the doctor's celebrity. But what really matters is that some of the emails raise more questions about the origin of Covid-19. 'From 2014-19, the National Institutes of Health sent $3. 4 million to the WIV Wuhan Institute of Virology through the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance. The NIH money was spent on researching bat coronaviruses, and it's likely the WIV conducted gain-of-function research to make them more deadly or infectious. 'Dr. Fauci has said his outfit didn't fund gain-of-function research; the EcoHealth Alliance funding was meant to go to collecting samples. But 'I can't guarantee everything that's going on in the Wuhan lab, we can't do that,  Dr. Fauci said Wednesday in an interview with NewsNation Now. Dr. Fauci also said this week that his emails 'are really ripe to be taken out of context' and that 'you don't really have the full context.  That may be true. But it's all the more reason to investigate the U. S. links to WIV and gain-of-function research. The issue relates to Covid's origins but also to the future risks and benefits of such research.\nMost of Fauci's biggest whoppers didn't need to be exposed in his email correspondence. In fact, he openly admitted to lying to the American people on multiple occasions. He told the New York Times that he moved the goal posts on herd immunity because of 'his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks'. It wasn't the only noble lie. 'When Sen. Rand Paul suggested the fully-vaccinated Fauci was only wearing a mask as a matter of theater, the doctor vehemently denied the claim. But a few weeks later Fauci told Good Morning America that he had kept wearing a mask because he 'didn't want to look like I was giving mixed signals'. It was all an act, none of it based on science---all of it based on optics.\nFauci deceived the public about whether masks were necessary early on to preserve the existing supply for hospitals and he deceived the public again later by deliberately lowballing the threshold of herd immunity we'd need to contain the virus. That wasn't 'science.  That was government disinformation from a bureaucrat who hoped to engineer a particular policy outcome. 'It's true that in some cases his views have changed as data on COVID has developed. For instance, Fauci supported reopening schools many months ago as it became clearer that children didn't do much to spread the virus. Some of his 'reversals' are good-faith changes of heart in response to new studies. But not all are, and enough attention has been paid to those cases by now that you'd think he'd be more modest in trumpeting the alleged innocence of his approach."

In this version, efforts to dismiss the lab leak theory prematurely are touted as proof of the pro-China bias of 'experts' like Fauci and the Democratic Party, who are more interested in kowtowing to Beijing than they are in pursuing the truth. (This version of events neglects Trump's extensive praise of the Chinese response to Covid-19 during the early months of the pandemic. ). 'The emails show nothing like this story being spun. But the right is in need of a scapegoatand not just for Covid-19. Thus far, Republicans and their media allies have struggled to find a consistently potent line of attack against President Joe Biden. One moment, they're casting him as a Stalinesque puppetmaster; the next he is a senile, powerless figurehead being manipulated by others behind the scenes. Fauci has, in recent days, arrived as a stand-in: a convenient means of savaging the Biden administration without having to attack Biden himself.\nThe same researcher who suggested the virus looked 'engineered' in the email in February 2020 concluded several weeks later that the lab leak theory was indeed implausible. 'Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,  the study said, while adding that 'it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here. . 'Fauci certainly cast doubt on the lab leak theory. But he generally couched it as there being no real evidence of it, rather the conclusive evidence to disprove it, and he was doing so at a time in which most other scientists were doing the same thing. There is quite simply no evidence that Fauci was delivered anything amounting to solid evidence of a lab leak.\nThough the lab leak theory has been embraced more on the political right, Rutgers University biologist Richard Ebright says it was Republican hawks under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney who pushed for the NIH to fund more of the sort of research that could have both health and bioweapons applications---or could be seen as defensive against biological attack. And it was academics on the left who warned this work could endanger our safety in the name of improving it. 'If Fauci owes the public an explanation for anything, it's why he approved funding for research that potentially made viruses more dangerous---so-called gain of function research. Though Fauci has been unofficially anointed America's 'top expert in infectious disease' by the press, his real job is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In that capacity, he's not above criticism. He's approved funding of projects on viruses that other scientists have deemed too risky to be worth doing. 'Faye Flam, BloombergRegarding Fauci's initial advice not to wear masks, 'In February and early March of 2020, anything Covid-19-related was unclear even to health professionals, and a leading line of discourse was that Americans should not wear masks because they weren't thought to be effective in screening out viral particles shed by others. While that information continues to be believed accurate. it was eventually found that encouraging everyone to wear masks helped to prevent the actively infected from spreading the shed viral particles as easily to others. 'There was also an effort to keep the panic-driven public from buying all available masks and putting health care workers at risk of running out of supplies. During a June 3 CNN interview addressing the emails, Fauci reiterated that if he had all the information he had today, his advice from early in the pandemic would be drastically different, and that masks do in fact work. But it doesn't look like Fauci's explanation will ease the backlash."

S. senator should be indicted. He was a Democrat. I also approved the prosecution of another sitting senator. He was a Republican. Those matters came up through the bureaucracy because they were highly visible and politically controversial. 'The decisions of the dedicated professionals who are the heart and soul of the department merit respect and a substantial degree of deference. But those decisions must also be subject to review. The higher the profile of a case, the more deserving it is of high-level attention, because the public will measure the department by its actions in such matters. Barr wasn't intervening inappropriately. He was doing his job. A more risk-averse attorney general might have let the recommendation stand and avoided a political hot potato. The American people might want to think twice before concluding that is the kind of attorney general the Justice Department should have.\nRoger Stone has been sentenced to 40 months by U. S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson. I previously stated that the likely sentence would be half of what the prosecutors originally sought and that is precisely what the court did. The sentence not only completed the conviction of Roger Stone but completely vindicated Attorney Bill Barr on the appropriate length of the sentence. 'While Judge Jackson stood up for the original prosecutors and called the sentencing change 'unprecedented,  she notably followed the Barr's call for sentencing below half of what the original prosecutors requested. I have been in cases. where prosecutors have sought excessive sentences but that does not make it acceptable or right. Given the overwhelming view that the original recommendation was wrong, I find it hard to understand why Main Justice should have stayed silent and not informed the court that justice would not be served with such a sentence.\nDOJ recommended 7 to 9 years. Trump tweeted. Barr defended DOJ's case but said that was too high. DOJ suggested 3 to 4 years. Barr told Trump to stop tweeting. Huge campaign to get Barr to resign. Obama-appointed judge sentenced Stone to just over 3 years.\nIf Barr were truly Trump's henchman, he would have squashed the Stone case rather than merely recommending a little less jail time at the end. Barr allowed the Mueller probe to reach its conclusion unmolested. The extent of his alleged interference was, prior to the release of the report, summarizing its findings in a way that wasn't harsh or detailed enough for Trump's critics. Finally, he declined to prosecute former Department of Justice official and frequent Trump target Andrew McCabe for lying to investigators. If Barr were really Trump's Roy Cohn, his personal enforcer masquerading as a top law-enforcement official, nailing McCabe would have been his Job One.\nThere is substantial new evidence that the foreperson of the jury that convicted Stone has a 'history of Democratic activism and a string of anti-Trump, left-wing social media posts.  Before she was ever picked as a juror, Tomeka Hart posted comments about the Stone case and mocked those who argued that his arrest was an example of excessive force. She praised the Mueller investigation and suggested that Trump and his supporters were racists. Trump was right when he called the Stone prosecution 'a miscarriage of justice.  That is a tweet to which Barr should pay attention."

The initial prosecutors argued that Stone's conduct deserved these enhancements because it involved threats of causing someone physical injury, substantial interference with the administration of justice, and attempted obstruction of the prosecution (via Stone's social media postings, including of a picture of crosshairs over Judge Jackson's image), and was extensive in scope. 'Barr confirmed that the decision to water down the initial prosecutors' requested sentence for Stone came from the highest levels of the Justice Department---and while he argued his decision was justified on the merits, the move raises questions about whether friends of the president have different standards applied to them by Justice Department leaders. 'Andrew Prokop, Vox\nEven the Justice Department's extraordinary decision to reverse course the next day noted that the guidelines 'enhancements'---the factors that led to the original sentencing recommendation---were 'perhaps technically applicable,  and prosecutors on Thursday did not dispute the applicability of those enhancements. In other words, Mr. Barr and those carrying out his wishes did not really dispute the facts and the law as carefully laid out by the career prosecutors. Instead, they presented a litany of the arguments that Mr. Stone's own lawyers had made for ignoring the guidelines and giving him lenient treatment. 'Here's a question the Justice Department has not answered: Can it point to a single case in which the defendant was not an ally of President Trump, or someone who could testify against the president, where the department overruled career prosecutors to ask for a sentence 'far less' than that called for by the sentencing guidelines in a case that went to trial? Maybe for a drug offender? Or someone who broke immigration laws?\nMr. Trump has claimed that the Constitution gives him 'the right to do whatever I want.  His lawyers have argued in a federal case involving his tax returns that a sitting president cannot even be investigated. They have also, in a head-spinning assertion of executive authority, dismissed any efforts by Congress to hold the president and the executive branch accountable. 'Characteristically, while interfering in the justice system, Mr. Trump is both insisting he's doing nothing of the sort and asserting his right to do so. 'Just so you understand, I chose not to be involved,  he said Tuesday in response to a question about his meddling in Mr. Stone's case. 'I'm allowed to be totally involved. . If there is anything useful to draw from Mr. Trump's degradation of the rule of law and the powers of his office, it's that he is exposing a critical vulnerability in the Constitution's design, which anticipated presidents behaving badly, but not this badly.\nIt's now time to ask: In a free society, dedicated to the rule of law, does it really make sense to say that the attorney general of the United States serves at the president's whim? . In many of the states, the attorney general is independent of the governor and the system seems to work well, or well enough. Congress should transform the Justice Department into an independent agency, legally immunized from the president's day-to-day control. the argument for an independent Justice Department seems at least as compelling as the argument for an independent Federal Reserve Board or Federal Communications Commission."

Pelosi had to bring along a caucus that wanted more comprehensive legislation that would cover all uninsured Americans rather than just many of them. She persuaded House Democrats to accept the best possible bill that the Senate would also pass.\nShe got the House to pass the $787 billion 2008 stimulus bill; the Dodd-Frank legislation reforming Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis; the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act attacking pay discrimination against women; and the repeal of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. Last year, under President Biden---and working with the slimmest of majorities---Pelosi shepherded through the House a $1. 9 trillion covid-19 relief package, a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that had been talked about for more than a decade; and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nMichigan Rep. Dan Kildee, a member of Democrats' whip team, told reporters Tuesday a story from when Pelosi was minority leader and Paul Ryan was speaker. It was during the water crisis in Flint, which Kildee represents. 'I still remember her calling me into her office from the floor, and getting on the phone with Paul Ryan, who was the speaker, and working it out for me to negotiate directly with Paul on Flint recovery,  Kildee said.\nShe told Ryan she could deliver the Democratic votes he needed to pass a spending bill in return for him funding one of their priorities, and sent Kildee to Ryan's office. 'And so, over the course of a couple hours,  he said, 'we worked out the Flint water crisis support, which was not widely supported by Republicans at the time.  God knows how many stories there are like this from Pelosi's tenure.\nWhen John Boehner took over as speaker in 2011, he'd already been the No. 2 person in the Republican leadership. When he stepped aside in 2015 he was replaced by Paul Ryan, the main architect of Boehner-era GOP policy priorities and a former vice presidential candidate. When Ryan, in turn, stepped down in 2019, he was replaced as GOP leader by Kevin McCarthy, who'd been the No. 2 guy under both Ryan and Boehner.\nBy contrast Representative Hakeem Jeffries, though seen for years as the heir apparent, is the fourth-ranking House Democrat---not No. 2---and has never chaired a committee. House Democrats ought to put in place structural reforms to ensure that more members Jeffries' age will have the ability to take on more substantive responsibility before reaching the top ranks of leadership."

        "document": "Pelosi has for the most part been a highly effective House caucus leader, from whom Republicans could learn important lessons about ruthlessness, party discipline, and how to set priorities. One of the most striking features of Pelosi's tenure has been her ability, time and time again, to get moderate members of her caucus to vote for things that cost them their jobs (Obamacare being the most famous example).\nHouse Democrats throughout her tenure have played to maximize the success of the team: When out of power, they relax their ideological litmus tests in order to elect moderate-sounding people in swing districts, and when in power, they get those people to vote for progressive policy priorities knowing full well that this is not what their constituents want. But it's what Nancy Pelosi wanted. That's political hardball. It's why Pelosi became speaker twice, why she got things done for two Democratic presidents in the role, and why she has twice now found herself losing the majority.\nAs liberal as Pelosi's record was. she also had a pragmatic streak and attempted to walk the more radical elements of her party back from the ledge. During the Bush era, she fought back efforts by progressives to 'defund' the Iraq War, fearing that it would backfire by making Democrats come off as anti-troop. During the Obamacare fight, she helped persuade progressives to vote for a final version of the bill that did not include a public option.\nNancy Pelosi is a liberal who advanced liberal policies, but relatively speaking, she was also more pragmatic than the younger, more extreme elements within the party. Though we don't mourn her stepping down, without her at the helm, Democrats may have even fewer guardrails to prevent the party's continued leftward drift.\nTraditionally, defeated Speakers usually leave Congress, but Pelosi herself had already been an exception to that rule. She lost the gavel in the 2010 midterms, and failed to regain it in three subsequent national elections, including the one in which Barack Obama narrowly won re-election to the presidency. She regained it in the 2018 midterms, but then managed to be the first Speaker in long memory to lose seats while her party elected a new president. As Speaker, Pelosi will go out with a won-loss record in elections of 4-6.\nThat's not exactly a great record for an 'emeritus' standing. However, Pelosi raises tons of money for other House Democrats, and if she assumes that role, she likely will continue to control campaign cash, or at least influence its direction. A diplomatic post in Rome might be a great lark, but it will end Pelosi's ability to control outcomes in the House."

        "document": "A trove of documents brought to the attention of the Supreme Court on Thursday makes it hard to see the Trump administration's efforts to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census as anything but a partisan power grab. An accurate and fair count of everyone in America isn't just any policy goal. There's much at stake with the 2020 census---from the future of the next redistricting cycle to how billions of dollars in federal funding will be allocated. The Supreme Court should see this new evidence for what it seems to reveal: A blatant attempt to rig a constitutional mandate.\nThe newly revealed documents show that the Trump administration's purpose in putting the citizenship question on the upcoming census was not its stated one to help Hispanic voters under the Voting Rights Act, but rather to create policy that would be 'a disadvantage to the Democrats' and 'advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.  It's difficult to produce a greater smoking gun than explicitly saying you are hoping to help the GOP by increasing white voting power. 'Even if it is otherwise constitutionally permissible to experiment with different understandings of how to draw districts with equal populations under the equal protection clause, the government should not be able to do so if the purpose is to dilute the power of political adversaries and minority voters, as demonstrated in this case by the new revelations.\nLong before Trump was even elected, Republican Party insiders were plotting to increase white political power at the expense of people of color. After Trump was elected, they implemented this plan by insisting that their actual goal was the protection of minority voting rights. there was the real reason and the stated reason, the truth and the pretext. 'That the Republican effort to increase white political power might be motivated by partisanship rather than racism is little solace. Segregationist Democrats might not have insisted on disenfranchising black voters after Reconstruction had those voters not been staunch Republicans. Whether motivated by partisanship or racism, though, the result is the same. Yet the census case does not hinge on whether the citizenship question is discriminatory. Rather, as a matter of administrative law, the executive branch must follow certain procedures before making decisions. The Trump administration's blatant dishonesty settles the question of whether it followed procedure definitively: It did not.\nFederal law protects the privacy of everyone who responds to the census. But that's small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercounted if there is a citizenship question on the census. 'By the bureau's own, nonpartisan analysis, adding a citizenship question to the 'short form' that will go to every household in America in 2020 could result in an undercount of 6. 5 million people---close to the entire population of Indiana or Tennessee. And the agency has told Mr. Ross that there are better alternatives to a citizenship question that wouldn't pose significant 'potential quality and cost disruptions' in administering the census, such as deriving citizenship data from the American Community Survey. At the heart of the dispute lies the question: Who gets to be counted?"

        "document": "During oral arguments in the case, the five conservative Justices seemed to agree with the Trump Administration that Congress has delegated to the Commerce Secretary broad authority over Census questions. As Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas noted in a related opinion last fall, it's not unconstitutional for cabinet officers to have political motives for a policy. Political appointees also consult with outside experts like Hofeller all the time, as the Obama Administration often did on regulation and litigation. The real goal of flogging the Hofeller memo now is to raise enough of a political stink to intimidate the Supreme Court to block the citizenship question.\nThe citizenship question was asked routinely until 1950, after which it was removed from the survey. In the midst of our current immigration crisis, there is certainly very good reason to know how many of the people in the country are citizens, and how many are essentially guests, whether invited or not. The nation ought to be able to have the facts at hand as we decide whether to close the southern border a la Trump or open it per Beto O'Rourke.\nEqualizing for citizen population, rather than total population, will have the effect of giving eligible voters equality of electoral power. Consider this: In states with large numbers of noncitizens such as Texas, New York, and California, some state legislative districts may have twice as many eligible voters as adjoining ones. This means districts with fewer citizens have more electoral power than the districts with more citizens. That isn't fair. 'Equalizing districts by the number of citizens prevents some voters from having their votes over-weighted and over-valued, while others are under-weighted and under-valued. If one-person, one-vote---one of our most enduring egalitarian principles---has any meaning, the citizen population gaps in voting districts must not be so glaringly wide. Without census data that includes citizenship status, it is probably not possible for states and smaller jurisdictions to draw election districts that equalize eligible voters.\nIt is worth noting that the citizenship question does not ask about a person's legal status; it merely asks about citizenship status and thus has nothing whatsoever to do with immigration enforcement. In fact, federal law prevents census data from being used for anything other than statistical analysis. That is the law and there is no evidence any agency intends to violate it. If there is a legitimate fear at all, it is that media hype may create a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is reckless and irresponsible of elected leaders in our country to give minorities the mistaken impression that they have anything to fear from the census for the sake of political gain.\nWhat is odd about the challenge by blue states and liberal advocacy organizations is that even the United Nations. sides with the Trump administration on this issue. In its 2017 'Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses,  the U. N. recommends that member countries ask census questions identifying both an individual's country of birth and country of citizenship. A Commerce Department memorandum on this subject dated March 26, 2018, notes that countries asking a citizenship question on their census include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom."

Add state taxes in Democratic enclaves and earners could pay well above 50% of what they earn to Uncle Joe. The plan is also a tacit admission that Medicare for All is a fiscal fantasy, since even current Medicare needs a giant tax increase. Imagine the rates required if Medicare covers those under age 65.\nThe White House proposal doesn't address any of Medicare's fundamental cost drivers, and even pretends it can rescue the program while charging seniors less. The fact sheet says the Administration will 'lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs subject to negotiation,  limit some prescription out-of-pocket costs to $2, and lower costs for mental-health visits. More subsidies mean more costs, which mean more taxes and price controls. The only good news is that this plan is a political document with no chance of passing this Congress.\nBiden claimed that the limited 'negotiations' in last year's massive spending bonanza will 'reduce the deficit by $159 billion.  But even when Biden's analysts originally claimed savings twice that large from price 'negotiations,  the Congressional Budget Office wrote: 'That decrease projected, but not yet realized was almost entirely offset by increases in projected outlays for other programs. .\nBut now, Biden wants us to believe that even more government price negotiations---he wants to adopt these even before the limited test project for negotiations has had a chance to prove itself---will save yet another $200 billion. Biden is promising changes that amount to hocus pocus to achieve savings for both government and seniors that history shows will probably never materialize.\nThe president's implication that full benefits can be paid without raising taxes for 98 percent of families has no basis in mathematical reality. Imagine that Congress let the Trump tax cuts expire, applied Social Security taxes to all wages, doubled the top two tax brackets to 70 and 74 percent, increased investment taxes, imposed Senator Bernie Sanders's 8 percent wealth tax on assets over $10 billion and 77 percent estate tax on estates valued at more than $1 billion, and raised the corporate tax rate back to 35 percent.\nCombined federal income, state and payroll marginal tax rates would approach 100 percent for wealthy taxpayers, and America would face among the highest wealth, estate and corporate tax rates in the developed world. Yet total new tax revenue---4 percent of G. D. P. ---would still fall short of Social Security and Medicare shortfalls that will grow to 6 percent of G. D. P. over the next three decades. Not even halving the defense budget would close the remaining gap."

Republicans have since tried to make it seem as if they never intended to gut the entitlements programs, despite widespread evidence to the contrary. His new budget proposal will force Republicans to make their stance on Medicare funding clear for all to see.\nBiden folded this proposal into claims that Democrats have already vitally improved Medicare's solvency via the cost-containment measures in the Affordable Care Act and the power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare that was featured in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. By proposing to strengthen 'Medicare's newly established negotiation power,  Biden is now exposing and exploiting the GOP's extremely unpopular stance of solidarity with Big Pharma.\nAt the same time, he's countering Republicans' bad intent toward Medicare benefits with populist rhetoric about making the rich pay 'just a little bit more of their fair share'. When Medicare was passed, the wealthiest one percent of Americans didn't have more than five times the wealth of the bottom 50 percent combined, as is now the case, so it only makes sense that some adjustments be made to reflect that reality.\nSome mix of benefit reductions and tax increases is necessary. Think about raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 to match the existing Social Security retirement age for those born in 1960 or later. Perhaps raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries with higher incomes. And maybe reduce Social Security benefits for those with higher incomes. Many of the Trump tax cuts expire in 2025. This could be leverage to negotiate tweaks to the payroll tax.\nWhat Republicans mostly talk about is raising the age cutoff for Social Security and Medicare. But while it's certainly true that people live longer than they used to, and remain in better health, the frame of reference for advocates of this idea is the professional class, to which most Americans don't belong. Less than 20 percent of all people aged 65 or older still work or seek work. Employers don't particularly want them.\nA better way to save Social Security? It's simple: Eliminate the regressive $160, 200 cap on payroll taxes. The Lakers pay LeBron James, the highest-paid NBA player in history, $44. 5 million. Why do we exempt $44. 3 million of that from the FICA tax? Were LeBron to protest that a 15 percent surtax on 100 percent of his income would be unreasonable, we could politely explain to him that that injustice is already visited on 94 percent of his fellow Americans.

I don't expect that anyone will move up or down in the polls very much based on their performance tonight. Sanders took more hits than he did last time, but not as many as I thought he would. Warren still pulled her punches, saying only that she could get things done better than Bernie. Klobuchar said pretty much the same thing. Bloomberg hit Bernie hard early on, but I'm not sure anyone noticed.\nCompared to her treatment of Bloomberg Warren treaded much more lightly with Sanders, although she did draw more of a contrast with him than she has in the past. 'Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie,  she said, explaining that she's had more success in the fights she's waged, such as pushing for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She said their plans for Medicare for All were similar, but his 'doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.  'I dug in,  Warren continued. 'I did the work, and then Bernie's team trashed me for it. We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done.  It was a clear shot, but like so many of the attacks leveled against Sanders tonight, it was a glancing blow. For Warren, as for the others, it might have come too late.\nBy far Sanders's most vulnerable moment came when Norah O'Donnell brought up Sanders's kind words for Cuban literacy programs. Like many leftists, Sanders expressed heavily caveated solidarity for leftist regimes like Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s, especially when those regimes were being threatened by right-wing authoritarian movements backed by the US. 'Sanders gave a satisfactory explanation of his comments on Cuba, situating them in the context of former President Barack Obama's historic opening to the country. 'Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba. I said what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education,  Sanders said. 'Occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran.  'Being honest' about topics that politicians aren't typically honest about is at the core of Sanders's appeal as a candidate, and he showed he could take the same approach when asked about Cuba. It was a good audition for the general, and crucially for a frontrunner, he did no harm to his standing in the primary.\nMeanwhile, 'Mayor Pete made a solid, regular case for just about every solid, regular subject. If this were a contest in sounding reasonable, then Buttigieg would run away with the contest. But the metronomic mayor regulates his beat a little too precisely to have a true pulse. Yes, he admitted, there was a progressive majority. 'But, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.  It takes a peculiar love of reason to think you can campaign against passion by pushing for lower blood pressure. Don't get too excited now.\nSome argue that 'The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor was at his absolute best in this debate. He found several occasions to make direct contrasts with Bernie Sanders -- most notably on the dangers for Democrats of nominating a democratic socialist and the differences in their health care plans -- which is a win in and of itself. Buttigieg also flashed a sense of humor when plugging his website to encourage donations, which was a welcome moment of levity in a debate defined by people shouting at one another at very close range. If voters were looking for a Sanders alternative who looked like he could be commander in chief in this debate, Buttigieg made a very good case for himself.\nFinally, 'By the metrics of shoring up his base, Biden did well. He was forceful and on message. He won much applause for his promise to appoint an African American woman to the Supreme Court. He kept alluding to his record as Obama's vice president and his experience on the world stage. Biden made the case for himself as a tough, experienced, and trustworthy leader."

Even Buttigieg and Kloubuchar were able to resist skewering each other. Only Elizabeth Warren seems not to have received the memo. She continued to savage Michael Bloomberg. Why she thinks this will help salvage her failing campaign is beyond me. 'As for the attacks on Sanders, I question whether they will set him back much. For one thing, most of the attacks centered on electability. The argument wasn't so much that Sanders is wrong on policy, but rather that the boldness of his proposals make him unelectable and will bring down Democratic congressional candidates. Sanders deflected this line of attack by citing polls that show him running ahead of President Trump. Moreover, many Democrats admire Sanders for his boldness, just as they did in 2016.\nAnother reason Sanders made it through the night: the nature of the criticisms of him. Attacking him from the left, as Biden did on guns, may score a debate point but isn't going to convince people that Biden is the more committed progressive. Sanders owns that territory. While Biden's attack on Sanders over his praise for the Cuban government was correct in its gist---he has been an apologist and contextualizer for left-wing dictators---the details were mistaken and won't hold up as the argument is litigated in coming days. Like Donald Trump in 2016, Sanders is also in the enviable position of being able to tell the voters he's courting that all the attacks on him are just proof that he is upsetting the establishment. 'For the most part, Sanders was able to avoid getting stuck defending himself. He answered nearly every criticism by returning to a familiar riff about billionaires. (He's against them. ) That tack won't work if he's the nominee. Voters at large are much more hostile to socialism, at home and abroad, than Democratic voters are. But it was enough to keep him just as secure in the front-runner position as he was at the start of the night.\nPete Buttigieg got off the best line when he said Sanders has 'nostalgia for the revolution politics of the '60s.  He was the only candidate on the stage who had a strategy to try and derail Sanders's momentum. He did what he could. But everybody else was just so lousy at it. Or, in the case of Warren, too wrapped up in her misty water-colored memories of her triumph over Bloomberg last week to pay attention to the guy who is actually eating her lunch---the guy who has every reason to think (no matter what happens in South Carolina) that he is heading inexorably for the center stage in Milwaukee.\nThere were three moments over the course of the night when Sanders and Buttigieg clashed in a serious, sustained way. In the first two, Buttigieg tried to make his point with the sort of rational 'Let's talk about that' lines that are his hallmark. And Sanders shouted at himover and over. Until Buttigieg eventually gave up and let Sanders have the floor. The third time this happened, Buttigieg forged ahead and didn't back down. But because he wasn't willing to raise his voice, Sanders shouted over him and drowned him out. This is Bernie's move. It's how he deals with being challenged. But ask yourself: Do you think Sanders is going to be better at dominance politics than Trump is? Because I'm not sure I'd like his chances in that matchup. 'Biden was feisty and sharp. He showed voters that he's a fighter and emphasized over and over the idea of getting things done. He hit Bernie early for having wanted to primary Barack Obama in 2012 and had a great line when asked about his support from African-Americans: 'I don't expect anything. I'm here to earn the vote. . At this point, Biden is a clear underdog. But he sure looks like the strongest challenger to Sanders.\nFinally, 'Mike Bloomberg cleared the exceptionally low bar of, 'better than last week.  He had some painfully unfunny planned jokes that landed with a thud, and when the topics turned to his weaknesses like stop-and-frisk and nondisclosure agreements with former employees, he looked tense. But Bloomberg had some good moments, and he's getting a bit more comfortable as the capitalist defender of charter schools and skeptic on marijuana legalization. The mood of the rest of the field is forcing Bloomberg to be the contrarian, which fits him. Bloomberg has few problems that can't be mitigated by another couple hundred million in television ads."

        "document": "This is 'a good deal for Democrats and a big retreat from the Trump administration, which called for $150 billion in spending cuts. The budget cuts in this deal would likely go into effect down the road, which means there's a chance a future Congress will overturn them down the line. The deal still has to be passed by the House and Senate, and signed by Trump. But by striking such a deal, congressional leaders and the Trump administration are averting a disaster scenario.\nDiscretionary spending has been declining steadily for four decades, interrupted only by the Iraq War and the Great Recession. The new budget deal will keep it at about 6 percent of GDP, the same as it was in 2000 and far less than it was in 1980. This is hardly a picture of a budget that's skyrocketing out of control. If the hawks want to gripe about mandatory spendingprimarily Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other social welfare programsthat's fine. Gripe away. But today's budget deal has nothing to do with that.\nMany argue, 'It's official: Conservatives only care about deficits when a Democrat is president. Everyone in Washington seems to suddenly accept the economic and political benefits of government spending, as the GOP hopes to keep the stock market goosed past Trump's reelection. While it's great that Washington appears to have avoided another truly stupid, self-inflicted government shutdown, Congress is whistling past the graveyard. That's because deficits are growing while the economy is booming---up 23% in the first nine months of the fiscal year alone. That's not supposed to happen. And there will be hell to pay when the remorseless math of rapidly falling tax revenue kicks in during the next downturn.\nIt's often overlooked, but the biggest economic improvement since Trump took office is more government spending.\nI don't doubt that many House members elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 truly thought they were helping the economy by trying to bring federal spending down. But Congressional Republicans' overall loss of interest in deficit reduction after Trump's inauguration does seem to indicate that partisan calculations were paramount. House Democrats, meanwhile, have far less ideological reason to oppose increases in government spending. But their unwillingness since taking charge in January to play hardball on legislation that might endanger the ongoing expansion also seems to bespeak a different attitude toward partisanship and macroeconomic policy. House Republicans were willing to hold the U. S. economy hostage for partisan advantage. House Democrats have not been.\nMany progressives seem to want Democrats to learn from the scorched-earth tactics of Republicans. But Republicans would be wiser to learn from the bargaining strategy of Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Except for a brief shutdown in January 2018 over immigration that was quickly, and wisely, abandoned, congressional Democrats haven't tried to take the government hostage during the Trump administration. (The only protracted shutdown of the Trump presidency was instigated by Trump, effectively taking his own government hostage in order to win border wall money. It didn't work. ) Instead, Democratic leaders have negotiated budget agreements with Republicans in good faith, and they have won policy victories in the process.\nRegarding the debt ceiling, 'rather than treating it as a matter of good housekeeping, politicians have fallen into the habit of flirting with default, engaging in bouts of brinkmanship that culminate in ad hoc deals on borrowing and spending. Congress seems unable to perform its duties unless it is acting under the threat of crisis. This is not a good way to run a government.\nIn 2011, debt-rating agency Standard & Poors decided the U. S. no longer deserved the firm's highest credit score, mostly because of the federal government's refusal to free the Treasury's borrowing authority from political gamesmanship. The Government Accountability Office said in 2012 that the delays in raising the debt ceiling in 2011 cost the government $1. 3 billion in higher interest payments that year. if political leaders want to prioritize fiscal responsibility, they shouldn't need a legal mechanism to do so; they should simply act accordingly."

        "document": "President Trump once vowed to drain the swamp, but by joining with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the latest budget deal, he has merely drained it of the Tea Party. There are many ways in which the Trump presidency has been disruptive to the status quo. But when it comes to spending and deficits, he has restored Washington to a much more conventional place in which both parties agree to ignore warnings of fiscal disaster, and resolve their differences by simply agreeing to spend more money. 'Trump's Republican Party may want to dismiss the importance of the debt, but the numbers don't lie. The nation's federal debt will surpass unprecedented levels in the coming decades, and neither party even wants to pretend to care about it.\nThe tea party burst into Washington pledging spending restraint, balanced budgets, and accountable government. Even the possibility of defaulting on the national debt was an acceptable price of reform. Roughly a decade later, budget deficits are again reaching $1 trillion, spending is soaring, Obamacare remains on the books, and Republicans are raising the debt limit and eviscerating their lead accomplishment, the Budget Control Act. With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?\nThis 'is exactly how Washington has worked for decades. This is a place where politicians splurge today, and promise to repent tomorrow. And where 'compromising' means adding your differences together, rather than splitting them. To understand what this means for the deficit, consider that if Congress had simply held spending growth to the rate of inflation after 2014, the deficit this year would be $400 billion, instead of more than $1 trillion. 'It's important to note that this problem is not being driven by Trump's tax cuts. Even with those cuts in place, federal revenues are near the postwar average, and they are slated to continue to claim a larger share of GDP each year for the next several decades. The problem is entirely on the spending side. The CBO's forecast has spending closing in on 30% of GDP by 2049---and that's assuming there aren't any major new entitlement programs. 'Editorial Board, Issues & Insights\nThe good newsthe only good newsis that the deal continues the Trump Administration's modest defense buildup. Several years in a row of predictable, higher funding will allow the Pentagon to improve the readiness of fighter squadrons, build a few more ships, improve missile defenses and invest in technologyall necessary for maintaining the military's competitive edge. The price Democrats extorted for essential national security is another two-year blowout in domestic accounts. 'Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are crowing that they 'secured an increase of more than $100 billion in funding for domestic priorities since President Trump took office.  This is all the more remarkable because Democrats have only had a majority in the House, and only for seven months. Everybody's happy except the future taxpayers who will pay for it.\nNevertheless, 'in these highly polarized times, just reaching this kind of agreement is an achievement in itself, no matter how unimaginative or bad it might be. Give Trump credit, seriously, for nailing down an agreement with the caucus that's currently battling over whether to impeach him. That credit gets split with Pelosi, who is trying mightily to quell impeachment talk so that Democrats can present some set of positive accomplishments on which to propose keeping their House majority in 2020.\nSome contend that 'we have big government because the voters want it that way. it is time for conservatives to understand there is no political will to significantly cut spending in the absence of an overall bipartisan deal. Rank-and-file Republicans may want lower spending, but they clearly prioritize other issues such as immigration, trade, tax cuts and religious liberty. It is also clear that moderates, both the Obama-Trump blue-collar types and the suburban Romney-Clinton voters, prefer much more spending than does the GOP's right. 'The Republican Party needs to show it understands what voters want by proposing a serious deficit-reduction package that includes tax increases on those who can afford it, in addition to a package of spending cuts. a new bipartisan compromise could achieve what a decade of futile gesturing has not: reduced deficits and moderate growth in government spending."

But it's also hard not to wonder why the situation couldn't have been defused without Adam being shot. This was a child, a 13-year-old. A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon? . 'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, 'despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. . 'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.\nThe post-Floyd reckoning in the media has emphasized the need for journalists to look skeptically at claims from police and other officials following a killing, as they may come undone when more facts come to light. 'Shortly after the March 29 death of Toledo, a Cook County prosecutor claimed that Toledo was shot while holding a gun in his right hand. But body camera footage released on Thursday suggests this claim was inaccurate, as it appears to show the boy unarmed and with his hands raised when he was shot. Officials also described the incident as an 'armed confrontation,  without noting that Toledo had complied with officer instructions to drop the firearm and put his hands up.\nJustice for Adam Toledo requires investments in our Black and brown communities and disinvestments in policing. One would be a proposal by the Chicago-based, Black youth-led GoodKids MadCity collective called the Peace Book, which would create neighborhood peace commissions with resources sufficient to meet community needs. The resources include funds for positive youth spaces, political and art education, mental health treatment, restorative justice, and conflict resolution services. The Peace Book could operate with a diversion of just 2 percent, or $35 million, from the CPD's budget. 'Second, the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance, sponsored by Chicago Democratic Socialist Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and backed by a diverse, citywide coalition, would prohibit CPD officers from responding to people in mental health crises and instead fund community-based mental health professionals. Similar programs in Oregon both reduce police violence and better serve community needs.\nAt a young age, Adam was categorized as a special education student and separated from everyone else at school. Surrounded by the same six students with varying degrees of severe learning disabilities, Adam didn't have the chance to develop strong friendships with any of his classmates. 'According to one teacher 'It was clear he needed someone to talk to and the space to socialize himself better. He really liked to draw, his penmanship was perfect. I think if we offered an art class, he would've taken it, but we don't even offer that to our students. He just needed one friend, one classmate or one other student he could connect with'. 'Defunding the police' means providing us with adequate funding for after-school programming, violence prevention initiatives, creative arts curricula and workforce development opportunities. Chicago, known across the world as 'Chiraq,  has fostered street gang culture for more than a half century. I was 15 years old the first time a gang member gave me a pistol. As children, we normalize gun violence to the degree of no longer flinching at the sound of gunshots. Adam Toledo did not deserve to be killed by Chicago police. He, like many children from our side of the city, deserves more."

        "document": "Cops know that armed suspects most often discard their weapons on first perceiving the arrival of the police. The reason for this is simple: better to ditch the gun than get shot or catch a case for holding onto it (you can always get another one later). 'If an armed suspect doesn't abandon his gun, the pursuing officer has no choice but to assume the suspect intends to use it against him, and any reasonable officer will respond accordingly at the first indication of such intent. Sadly for Toledo, perhaps due to his youth and inexperience, he acted in such a way that his movements were interpreted as preparation to fire rather than discard the gun he carried. 'In Graham v. Connor (1989), the U. S. Supreme Court held that the 'reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  So, viewing the events from this perspective, we have Officer Stillman responding to reported gunshots at 2: 30 a. m. and confronting two males in the immediate vicinity. 'Both of those males refuse to comply with a uniformed police officer's clearly stated orders to stop, and one of them runs nearly the length of a football field before stopping, pulling a gun from his pocket or waistband, and turning toward Stillman. On seeing the gun, Stillman reasonably believed Toledo was preparing to shoot him and fired in self-defense, striking Toledo in the chest.\nLess than one second elapsed between Toledo beginning his turn toward the officer with a gun in his right hand and then dropping the gun, and the officer firing a single shot from his service weapon. And these were not ideal conditions in which to make a split-second decision: it was dark, and Stillman's heart rate and adrenaline levels were likely elevated due to the foot chase. 'Was it really so unreasonable for Stillman to have genuinely perceived a risk to his own life when he decided to pull the trigger? I don't think so, but I'm certain of one thing: that's not a question you can answer based on a single, out-of-context freeze-frame. Those who attempt to do so show their extreme ignorance of the realities of dynamic situations like these. 'Such hasty conclusions also reinforce cops' perception, which I suspect is becoming even more widespread, that they should not expect fair treatment if they have the misfortune of being involved in a use-of-force incident. As that perception deepens among cops, we run the risk of more and more officers prioritizing risk-minimization over being proactive. As the past year of escalating crime has shown us, that's a recipe for more tragedy. 'Rafael A. Mangual, City JournalSome argue that 'I hate to second-guess the officer, who was involved in a foot chase and undoubtedly surging with adrenaline, knowing that he was looking for an armed suspect. I hate to do it, but we have to because this sort of thing happens way too often. We also have to second-guess the entire police department because, if not for the body camera, the official record would reflect that Toledo was holding a gun when he was shot by Stillman. When government lawyers tell lies that are contradicted by body camera footage, is it any wonder that people mistrust the police? . 'I am not advocating for defunding the police, but we do need police reform. There are a few ideas that seem like good places to start. The first is to better screen police applicants and weed out people who are too aggressive and combative. Another important reform is better training. Too often, the reaction is to shoot first and ask questions later. Several veterans have made the point that American soldiers serving in combat zones have more strict rules of engagement than police officers patrolling American cities. This needs to change. 'I don't believe that Officer Stillman set out that night to kill a child. I also don't think that he shot Toledo. because he was a minority kid. But the fact remains that Stillman did kill an unarmed seventh-grader."

But this bill throws money at far more than that, with only $110 billion reserved for this traditional infrastructure. The bill includes tens of billions in public broadband subsidies that will pre-empt private investment. Amtrak gets a $66 billion bailout. 'The Congressional Budget Office (CB0) found the bill will add $256 billion to the federal deficit over 10 years, plus another $196 billion over the 2021 budget baseline in the government's contract authority.\nThe federal government already spends more than enough on infrastructure to meet our needs and the COVID-19 bailout money left many states awash in cash. Despite promises, only a small portion of the bill focuses on traditional infrastructure such as fixing roads and bridges and the legislation (soon to be law) will add $256 billion to deficits. 'It will also help grease the wheels for the passage of the larger multi-trillion welfare bill that will expand Medicare and Obamacare, initiate a federal takeover of preschool and child care, and impose economically devastating tax increases on individuals and businesses. 'Biden entered this week reeling from a devastating rebuke of his presidency by voters in areas of the country thought to be reliably Democratic. He headed into the 2022 election year a wounded animal, and Republicans stood to make major gains. Now, they tossed him a life raft and allowed him to put bipartisan gloss on his radical agenda. Every Republican who voted for this monstrosity who is not already retiring should be primaried and defeated. 'Philip Klein, National ReviewOther argue, 'It's true that without the 13 Republicans, the bill would not have passed Friday night. But. there was simply no way that the progressive House members were going to allow their party to march into 2022 with absolutely nothing to show for all of their efforts. 'At best, they would have stymied the infrastructure bill until the CBO finished scoring the reconciliation package. If it was still over the limits demanded by the moderates, Biden and Pelosi would have found something to lop off to get it down to the required amount and both of the bills would have passed with no GOP support anyway. 'This legislative agenda is obviously not one that many (or any) conservatives or Republicans should be cheering for. But the reality is that the Democrats currently hold all three of the levers of power at the federal level and they were always going to try to leverage that power to further their own agenda. If we don't want that to happen, the only real solution is to be smarter, fight harder, and win more elections. Passing an actual infrastructure bill is part of the business of government and it would have to be done sooner or later."

Multiple administrations and Congresses talked about addressing the problem. 'Infrastructure week' became a running gag during Donald Trump's presidency, because of his constant invocation of the concept and complete inability to deliver on it. But Joe Biden has delivered. This is a major win for America.\nThere is a great deal to celebrate in the package, which independent economists say may create over half a million jobs. As well as investing in America's physical infrastructure like road, rail and broadband networks, it also makes the country's first major investment in helping communities prepare for extreme weather events caused by climate change. There's also chunks of money to upgrade the electrical grid and protect it from extreme weather, to expand the nation's network of electric vehicle charging stations, and to invest in experimental forms of clean energy. 'No-one should mistake this for anything other than a major victory for the Biden administration, which even managed to persuade a sizeable number of Republicans in the Senate and the House to vote in favor. It's exactly the type of major bipartisan win which Joe Biden promised during his campaign, and which naysayers said he would never achieve.\nSkittish Democrats complain Biden and his team have done too little to trumpet their successesincluding the American Rescue Act, which helped keep the economy afloat and provided lifelines to millions of Americans through stimulus checks and a landmark family tax credit projected to cut child poverty in half. 'But the Delta variant, natural disasters like Hurricane Ida, and the fallout from the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan prevented the Biden administration from finding the right opportunity to sell the legislation, along with the rest of his agenda, to the American people. 'Now, having passed another major legislative package, Biden and the Democratic Party have a second chance to make clear what they have delivered. Biden's task is to move beyond the unsightly legislative sausage-making and convert his victory into tangible signs of progress, be they roads, bridges or broadband Americans can see in their own communities.\nPassing the infrastructure bill counts as a significant victory for Biden. But there is still the reconciliation package -- and plenty more to be done beyond that. If the Democrats cannot offer tangible progress on the economy, the pandemic and popular social policies like paid family leave, they will likely be looking at Republican congressional majorities in 2023 and a very competitive presidential election the year after. But if they keep problem-solving, the party can beat the odds."

        "document": "In 2006's notorious Garcetti v. Ceballos, the Supreme Court's conservatives held that government employees have no free speech rights while performing their official duties. Kennedy was obviously in the midst of his official duties when he kneeled on the field, in uniform, responsible for the conduct of his students. And when he led his prayer circles, he was not 'quiet,  but loud and prominent by design. His expression was a quintessential example of on-the-job 'government speech' that, according to Garcetti, falls outside the First Amendment.\nTo reach his conclusion, Gorsuch simply rewrote the facts. In his account, Kennedy had been suspended exclusively for his silent prayernot the spectacle he created by hijacking football games with prayer circles. And because this prayer was allegedly so 'quiet,  it qualified as 'private' expression shielded by the First Amendment.\nThe coach's prayer, Gorsuch insisted, was 'not delivered as an address to the team, but instead in his capacity as a private citizen.  So even though he was in the middle of a field that he could only access because he was performing his job responsibilities, his speech bore no imprint of government approval, and was totally unconnected to his work as a coach.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, declared: 'Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse Republic---whether those expressions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether they manifest through the spoken word or a bowed head. .\nIn doing so, Sotomayor wrote, the court 'elevates one individual's interest in personal religious exercise, in the exact time and place of that individual's choosing, over society's interest in protecting the separation between church and state, eroding the protections for religious liberty for all. \nThere is a greater issue that the majority, in their zeal, chose to ignore: the freedom of the students to not pray. I'm sure they would say that this freedom remains, and no one has to pray if they choose not to. But such a perspective is risible. Anyone who has ever played high school sports knows that if your coach is doing something, particularly something religious, and expects you to join, then you had better do it. To stand out and say, 'I am Jewish' or 'I am Muslim' or 'I am an atheist'or even simply 'I don't want to do that'is to be labeled a distraction, a locker-room cancer, or worse.\nIt's not just about limiting your time on the field. It's also about making you an outcast among your teammates, a prospect in your teen years about as painful and harmful as not being able to play a sport you love. It's easier to just take a knee for a minute rather than reap the whirlwind of anger from your coach. That is why this is not about freedom but coercion."

Justice Gorsuch replies that the First Amendment makes both promises in a single sentence. 'A natural reading,  he says, 'suggest the Clauses have 'complementary' purposes, not warring ones.  He says the school punished Mr. Kennedy under 'a mistaken view that it had a duty to ferret out and suppress religious observances. .\nThe Supreme Court is gradually restoring a proper constitutional understanding of the relationship between religion and the state. The Court in the 20th century began to use the Establishment Clause to let government restrict religious behavior and speech that is protected by the Free Exercise Clause. The Roberts Court's religious liberty rulings don't risk any state establishment of religion. But they do let Americans of faith express their viewsas the Founders intended.\nThere is no indication in the record that anyone expressed any coercion concerns to the district about the quiet, postgame prayers that Kennedy asked to continue and that led to his suspension. Nor is there any record evidence that students felt pressured to participate in these prayers.\nThe district suggests that any visible religious conduct by a teacher or coach should be deemedwithout more and as a matter of law impermissibly coercive on students. Such a rule would be a sure sign that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence had gone off the rails.\nInstead of a court-invented three-part test. Gorsuch and his five colleagues offer an empirical analysis of historical practices and understandings as a way to judge whether a government entity has violated the First Amendment by becoming too enmeshed in promoting religion. That is exactly as it should be. The original public meaning of the First Amendment, Gorsuch explained, 'counsels mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike. .\nGorsuch wrote: 'Learning to tolerate speech of prayer of all kinds is 'part of learning how to live in a pluralistic society,  a trait of character essential to 'a tolerant citizenry.  He also noted: 'Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse republic.

The reporting requirement in force in 2008, he says, excepted all 'accommodations and transportation for social events,  although it was recently clarified to require greater disclosure. In fact, the 2008 hospitality exclusion applied only to food, lodging and entertainment, with no mention of transportation.\nAlito can argue the finer points of disclosure and recusal, but there is a greater issue involving the justices' ready acceptance of lavish gifts from wealthy and politically active benefactors. Alito and Thomas, and perhaps others yet unknown, have not hesitated to vacation on the tab of the super-rich, rationalizing that they avoid talking law with their hosts, who, they assure themselves, do not have cases before the Court.\nBut influence does not arise only from outright favor-trading. Studies have shown that physicians' prescribing practices can be influenced by such minor gifts as pens, notepads and sandwiches. One study of over 125, 000 physicians found that receipt of a single inexpensive meal was associated with increased prescriptions of the donor's brand-name medication. Supreme Court justices no doubt believe they are immune to such effects, but so do doctors.\nCan anyone say with a straight face that no 'unbiased and reasonable person' would question the justice's impartiality when he votes for someone who gave him a valuable gift? Isn't there at least the appearance that something other than the strict application of the rule of law is at work? And appearances count, perhaps nowhere more than at the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of many of the most fraught issues of American life.\nIf the justices are confused as to the reason public trust in the court is in free fall, they need look no further than Justice Alito's smug, defensive reaction to a very fair criticism. As long as the court refuses to accept significantly stricter ethics rules, either adopted by themselves or imposed by Congress, that trust---and with it the court's legitimacy---will continue to erode until it's not worth a seat on a private jet.\nProPublica's reporting hints at the larger scandal of conservative donors becoming financially enmeshed with the justices they sponsor. Alito's stay at the resort 'was provided free of charge by another major donor to the conservative legal movement: Robin Arkley II,  it reports.\nAnd Singer's Supreme Court case 'featured an unusual intervention by the Judicial Crisis Network, a group affiliated with Leonard Leo known for spending millions on judicial confirmation fights. The group filed a brief supporting Singer, which appears to be the only Supreme Court friend-of-the-court brief in the organization's history. .\nThe whole arrangement is highly convenient for the right: The conservative legal movement has seized unassailable control of the Supreme Court and its members are so deeply invested in the goals and worldview of the conservative movement and its donors that the component parts can hardly be separated. The most powerful body in the government happens to be the one that is allowed to follow the most lax ethics requirements."

Moreover, even if Alito should arguably have recused himself for all time from Singer-related cases, the court papers in the case also didn't disclose---and weren't legally required to disclose---that the NML Capital fund was a Singer vehicle.\nProPublica and other captive outlets of the Democratic Party are doing whatever they can to create 'scandals' around the Supreme Court. It's not that they expect any particular faux-scandal to stick, but they hope that raising one after another will create a generalized perception that the court is corrupt, and its decisions---say, overturning affirmative action, or upholding gun rights---will thus be delegitimized, making it easier for Democratic officials to disobey them.\nAt the same time, the 'ethics' attacks on the court serve as a smokescreen to conceal the much bigger ethical problems that go unaddressed. ProPublica, for example, crusades against fully publicized matters like Alito's trip, even as it rakes in millions of dollars from undisclosed donors. Per the Washington Free Beacon: In 2020 and 2021, 'ProPublica accepted $6. 3 million from anonymous donors, and a quarter of the group's revenues in 2022 came from two unnamed donors. \nIf we are supposed to assume that casual exposure to billionaires is inherently corrupting, what does it say about ProPublica that its funding comes from organizations like the Sandler Foundation? That institution, which was described by Forbes magazine as having 'instituted borrowing practices that were largely blamed for the housing market collapse' in 2008, also financially supports the left-wing group Demand Justice, which advocates packing the Supreme Court.\nThis would be a shoddy indictment of ProPublica if it were the only prism through which we viewed its work. It is an exercise aimed at establishing guilt by association. But that is precisely the enterprise in which ProPublica is engaged. The Wall Street Journal editorial page deserves commendation for attempting to break the rhythm of this tawdry onslaught of defamation and agitation. Others should follow its lead."

        "document": "There is only one issue in front of American voters. That issue is not about past votes in the Senate, who supported the war in Iraq, or how to unite the Democratic party. It's about how to survive the health and financial disaster that lies ahead. Sanders did a fine job of pinning Biden down on his past readiness to include social security in budget debates, and on his lack of details about how he would address the climate crisis. But scoring points doesn't count for much when the economy is in freefall and America's cities are shutting down to slow the pandemic's spread.\nBiden was about as sharp as he's been throughout the entire primary. He projected confidence and competence on the coronavirus pandemic, arguably beating Bernie on points when it came to Medicare-for-all's relevance to the crisis. He got in some solid hits on Sanders's record, particularly on guns and immigration, and offered up one of the night's most memorable lines about the primary during an exchange on campaign finance: 'I didn't have any money and I still won'. This should quiet at least some of worrying about whether he can withstand the rigors of a campaign and the presidency.\nBiden is very much a politician's politician (even Bernie Sanders likes him) and his restorationist, pro-system attitude reflects more than simple nostalgia. The former vice president, after all, acknowledges that there are real problems with the status quo. His complaint with Medicare-for-all is the practical politician's complaint---it's a nonstarter. Sanders has never produced a detailed financing plan or theory of exactly how his vision for single-payer should work. His team thinks organizing is prior to wonkery, and the point is to lay down a principle. 'By contrast Biden says he has a health care plan focused on an expansion with a public option that could really pass if Democrats win in 2020, thus helping people with their health care problems. He never actually says his proposal represents some kind of moral ideal. Indeed, it's not at all clear what Biden thinks an ideal health care system would look like. It's simply not the kind of question that interests him. Biden is doing politics. Bernie has been a politician a long time (and quietly knows how to do it pretty well) but fundamentally has the persona of a prophet. Democrats' choice is clearer than ever: Fight Trump or fight for revolution.\nBiden tried to extend olive branches to Sanders and his supporters Sunday night -- though his rival wasn't ready to bridge their ideological divides. The former vice president pointed to his moves within the previous two days to embrace free public university tuition for those whose families make less than $125, 000 per year and to embrace Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to undo much of a bankruptcy bill they'd fought over 15 years earlier. 'I agree with Bernie,  Biden said as they discussed surging help to hospitals facing the coronavirus pandemic. 'I agreed with Bernie,  he said later when noting they both believed those on Wall Street responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should have gone to jail.\nA word of advice to Joe Biden after Sunday night's debate: Call AOC. The politician who has shown the most lucid understanding of the importance of Democratic unity in the face of Donald Trump is Sanders' most obvious successor: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has urged the Democratic establishment to begin a conversation with younger Democrats. Rather than dwell on Sanders' likely defeat, she has already set her sights on obtaining concessions from Biden. 'Only 5 percent of young Latinos voted for Biden in California. The national picture is just as worrisome. As a proficient Spanish speaker who relates directly to the issues that have made progressive politics so relevant within the Latino community, Ocasio-Cortez could quickly upend that narrative. Granted, there isn't much competition, but no Hispanic politician can match her charisma. if she manages to navigate the tightrope between the Democratic party's progressive and moderate wings, Ocasio-Cortez could become Joe Biden's most important ally, a future presidential contender in her own right and Bernie Sanders' rightful heir as the voice of the progressive movement."

        "document": "Heading into tonight, the majority of Democrats appeared set on nominating Joe Biden. Nothing that happened tonight changed the current trajectory. Quite a few of the debates this cycle felt like frustrating wastes of time, but this one felt particularly moot. The second hour was the non-coronavirus section, and the back-and-forth exchanges about climate change, fracking bans, immigration enforcement, and abortion access felt like a historical relic. Kids may not go back to school before autumn, and the economy is about to get pummeled, which makes the issue of the temperature in a hundred years seem particularly insignificant in the here and now.\nBernie is, in practical terms, finished, and he plainly knows it. His clear goal in this debate, in the vein of issue and movement candidates since time immemorial, was to push his agenda on the party. Biden, though he came onstage wearing a red tie, took the bait. He bragged about his shifts to the left on abortion and immigration. He promised 'no new fracking,  committed to crackdowns on oil drilling, and pledged himself to the 'New Green Deal.  Some of those lines were delivered in gift-wrapped sound bites for the Trump campaign. All of which is why Biden, though he looked better than usual in this format, probably won't want to debate Bernie Sanders again.\nBiden's new position on immigration is that if he is elected, no one will be deported in his first 100 days as president. And he said a person who enters the U. S. illegally won't be deported even if the person has a criminal record in any foreign country, unless the immigrant is convicted of a felony in the U. S. That position on deportations is an extreme one that could cost Biden votes even in Hispanic communities among people who fear that new neighbors who have committed crimes elsewhere might commit crimes again in the U. S. 'Then Biden sought to appease the environmental community by pledging that there would be 'no new fracking' if he becomes president, and also said he would ban drilling for fossil fuels on public lands. Given the importance of fracking to the economies of key electoral states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Colorado, Biden is opening himself up to relentless attacks by Trump in the fall that he is anti-jobs and that he would make America dependent on imported oil and natural gas.\nSanders argues that if we had socialized health insurance right now, nobody would have to pay for testing or treatment for the coronavirus. That's true, and if the only alternative were a total laissez-faire healthcare system, most of the population might side with Sanders. 'Sanders wants to expand the argument from people with the coronavirus shouldn't have to pay for treatment, to people with illness or injury shouldn't have to pay for treatment. But here's the thing: It's very sensible to have targeted government-guaranteed coverage for the coronavirus and not for broken bones. For one, the coronavirus looks like a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Second, it's incredibly contagious, and thus there are large externalities, and that's the problem here. In other words, there's a strong case for government action in this specific case---it's a lot simpler than a revolution.\nSome argue that 'Bernie Sanders gave his best debate performance of the 2020 presidential campaign. For the first time since these exchanges began last June, the Vermont senator got angry. He also got specific. On issue after issue, from immigration to health care to student debt to foreign policy, he challenged Joe Biden's record. The former vice president rolled his eyes, quibbled, and at times simply denied his own past votes. 'Sanders' best and last pitch was his most effective, one that he should have been making explicitly for the last nine months, namely, that Biden's campaign will not inspire the country. He will have the support of the Democratic establishment and many of the party's most reliable voters. He will also likely enjoy the support of some traditional Republican voters in wealthy suburbs across the United States. But that will not necessarily translate into the only thing that really matters: taking back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all three of which will likely be necessary for Democrats to win in November."

        "document": "Chauvin should have been arrested days ago, if not immediately. The claim that the prosecutor had to wait to authorize an arrest until the investigators nailed down all the evidence is nonsense. I don't look at this as a racial issue, or a 'cops against black men' issue. It is a matter of equal protection under the law. Any civilian, regardless of race, who did what Chauvin did would have been placed under arrest. 'Investigators did not need to be sure that they could make a third-degree murder charge stick to know that some kind of prosecutable homicide happened in the killing of George Floyd. This was not a fleeting incident, or a situation in which Floyd was resisting---he was pleading for his life. At the very least, this was a negligent homicide.\nChauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Good: Police use of such unnecessary force is a betrayal of every good cop and of the public itself. Outrage over it is entirely righteous. But that outrage shouldn't be directed at innocents and culminate in yet more senseless violence. Another man died in Minneapolis when protests turned violent. Angry mobs set fire to a police precinct and several private businesses. 'The rioters also burned something that would've helped the community: the site of an affordable-housing project that was to provide 189 low-income apartments, including dozens of super-low-income ones.\nWe must distinguish rioting and looting from protesting. Look at the long-term studies done on rioting. Riots harm their communities. They don't reform them. They often initiate a general spike in violent crime. Baltimore saw this spike in the past half-decade. Riots dissuade individuals, families, and businesses from staying in or joining a community. Who wants to raise their kids in the neighborhood where the police station had to be evacuated before it was set ablaze? . . . George Floyd's girlfriend said, 'I am heartbroken. Waking up this morning to see Minneapolis on fire would be something that would devastate Floyd. \nThere is a striking pattern of evidence, teased out in the research of the Princeton political scientist Omar Wasow, showing how peaceful civil rights protests helped Democrats win white votes, and then violence pushed white voters toward Republicans. Looking at data from the civil rights era, Wasow argues that 'proximity to black-led nonviolent protests increased white Democratic vote-share whereas proximity to black-led violent protests caused substantively important declines'---enough to tip the 1968 election from Hubert Humphrey to Nixon. 'The political history of both the 1960s and the 2010s suggests a strong presumption against the political effectiveness of looting or vandalism or arson, to go along with the direct costs for the communities where riots are most likely to break out. Martin Luther King Jr. became more politically radical in his last years, but his opposition to rioting was a constant. 'Every time a riot develops,  he warned just months before his death, 'it helps George Wallace.  If we are headed for a long, hot, virus-shadowed summer, those are words that a liberalism that doesn't want to help Donald Trump would do well to keep in mind.\nThe national media have been insisting on the theme of the allegedly brutal Minneapolis police department. But Why are the Minneapolis police in black neighborhoods? Because that's where violent crime is happening, including shootings of two-year-olds and lethal beatings of 75-year-olds. Just as during the Obama years, the discussion of the allegedly oppressive police is being conducted in the complete absence of any recognition of street crime and the breakdown of the black family that drives it. 'Once the violence began, any effort to 'understand' it should have stopped, since that understanding is inevitably exculpatory. The looters are not grieving over the stomach-churning arrest and death of George Floyd; they are having the time of their lives. You don't protest or mourn a victim by stealing oxycontin, electronics, jewelry, and sneakers.\nSome urge that 'we as Americans can't let the smoke obscure the very real issues we must confront. We can't ignore the issues of inequality in this country. No one can claim with a straight face that black and brown kids in the inner cities get an education equal to what kids in the suburbs receive. No one can deny that minorities find themselves on the wrong end of our justice system in unequal numbers. No one with a heart can watch these murders and not feel deep sadness, anger, and even guilt."

But this is the pattern, the maddening pattern, that so many of us who are not African American can empathize with but never truly absorb. Because death by police, for black people in this country, is too often over nothing. A $20 bill. Someone selling illegal cigarettes. A cellphone or bottle of pills assumed to be a gun. . . 'Unarmed, yet shot. Unarmed, yet strangled. Unarmed, yet dead. George Floyd is not the first black man to die from a white cop's indifference. He's not even the first to die from a chokehold. When something unforgivable happens over and over again, what are people to do? Where does the grief and the anger go?\nBlack people are about twice as likely as white people to be pulled over by law enforcement for a traffic stop. Black Americans are much more likely to be arrested and charged for drug-related crimes, despite no significant disparity in how much those populations actually use narcotics. White defendants are substantially more likely than black defendants to have their most serious charge dismissed as part of a plea bargain. Even when black men and white men are convicted of the same crime, the black men can expect a prison sentence that is 20 percent longer. 'One study found black Americans were less likely to have their complaints against law enforcement officers sustained compared to complaints by white people. That was especially true for complaints of excessive force. The list could go on. But the point is made. Racial discrimination is pervasive in American criminal justice, manifesting in every step from arrest to trial to conviction and incarceration.\nWhen you are oppressed there is no acceptable way to fight against your oppression. You get branded 'unpatriotic' for peacefully taking a knee to protest against police brutality. You get vilified for using boycotts as a non-violent tool of resistance. You get called 'THUGS' when, after the murder of yet another unarmed black man by the police, you protest in the streets. If violent unrest isn't the answer then what is? How exactly do you go about ending police brutality and systemic racism in America?\nNew York police drove an SUV through a crowd of protesters in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn; by sheer good luck, no one was seriously hurt. In Atlanta, police assaulted two people in a car for no evident reason, smashing the windows, subduing the couple with Tasers and forcibly dragging them from the vehicle. In Erie, Pennsylvania, a young woman was maced and then kicked by police while she was sitting on the ground. In Salt Lake City, an officer shoved an elderly man with a cane to the street. Numerous journalists have been shot, beaten, attacked or arrested by police. 'If you want to argue that 'violence'---a term that lacks a clear definition---is always pointless and never accomplishes anything, then I would suggest that you read some history about the French Revolution or the American Revolution or the ANC under apartheid or the IRA or the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist movements of the '60s and '70s. But first of all, try to tell that one to America's cops. They don't seem to agree. 'Andrew O'Hehir, Salon\nThe demonstrations around the country take as their starting point that police are brutalizing citizens of color. Law-enforcement officers and agencies have two ways to respond: They can affirm that complaint with aggressive policing and overwhelming force, or they can work to show they are on the same side, against brutality.\nSome urge that 'We must confront the deep legacy of bigotry that leads too many black and brown and immigrant lives to be treated with callous disregard and sometimes become the victims of pure hate. But the answer does not lie in demonizing all police officers or indiscriminately destroying property. That will only spur a backlash and lead some to see moral equivalence between the two sides in the larger struggle between right and wrong. The riots in the late 1960s only succeeded in burning out inner cities and electing Richard Nixon on the back of his Southern strategy. 'We need to learn the lessons of history -- both the legacy of systemic racism and the backlash against social chaos that benefits people who practice the politics of fear and division under the name of law and order. A relatively small number of people acting in bad faith can derail a movement, delay justice and divide a nation. With a presidential election now just five months away we can't let the forces of chaos and conflict win again."

        "document": "Cops know that armed suspects most often discard their weapons on first perceiving the arrival of the police. The reason for this is simple: better to ditch the gun than get shot or catch a case for holding onto it (you can always get another one later). 'If an armed suspect doesn't abandon his gun, the pursuing officer has no choice but to assume the suspect intends to use it against him, and any reasonable officer will respond accordingly at the first indication of such intent. Sadly for Toledo, perhaps due to his youth and inexperience, he acted in such a way that his movements were interpreted as preparation to fire rather than discard the gun he carried. 'In Graham v. Connor (1989), the U. S. Supreme Court held that the 'reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  So, viewing the events from this perspective, we have Officer Stillman responding to reported gunshots at 2: 30 a. m. and confronting two males in the immediate vicinity. 'Both of those males refuse to comply with a uniformed police officer's clearly stated orders to stop, and one of them runs nearly the length of a football field before stopping, pulling a gun from his pocket or waistband, and turning toward Stillman. On seeing the gun, Stillman reasonably believed Toledo was preparing to shoot him and fired in self-defense, striking Toledo in the chest.\nLess than one second elapsed between Toledo beginning his turn toward the officer with a gun in his right hand and then dropping the gun, and the officer firing a single shot from his service weapon. And these were not ideal conditions in which to make a split-second decision: it was dark, and Stillman's heart rate and adrenaline levels were likely elevated due to the foot chase. 'Was it really so unreasonable for Stillman to have genuinely perceived a risk to his own life when he decided to pull the trigger? I don't think so, but I'm certain of one thing: that's not a question you can answer based on a single, out-of-context freeze-frame. Those who attempt to do so show their extreme ignorance of the realities of dynamic situations like these. 'Such hasty conclusions also reinforce cops' perception, which I suspect is becoming even more widespread, that they should not expect fair treatment if they have the misfortune of being involved in a use-of-force incident. As that perception deepens among cops, we run the risk of more and more officers prioritizing risk-minimization over being proactive. As the past year of escalating crime has shown us, that's a recipe for more tragedy. 'Rafael A. Mangual, City JournalSome argue that 'I hate to second-guess the officer, who was involved in a foot chase and undoubtedly surging with adrenaline, knowing that he was looking for an armed suspect. I hate to do it, but we have to because this sort of thing happens way too often. We also have to second-guess the entire police department because, if not for the body camera, the official record would reflect that Toledo was holding a gun when he was shot by Stillman. When government lawyers tell lies that are contradicted by body camera footage, is it any wonder that people mistrust the police? . 'I am not advocating for defunding the police, but we do need police reform. There are a few ideas that seem like good places to start. The first is to better screen police applicants and weed out people who are too aggressive and combative. Another important reform is better training. Too often, the reaction is to shoot first and ask questions later. Several veterans have made the point that American soldiers serving in combat zones have more strict rules of engagement than police officers patrolling American cities. This needs to change. 'I don't believe that Officer Stillman set out that night to kill a child. I also don't think that he shot Toledo. because he was a minority kid. But the fact remains that Stillman did kill an unarmed seventh-grader."

But it's also hard not to wonder why the situation couldn't have been defused without Adam being shot. This was a child, a 13-year-old. A trained adult police officer couldn't have detained the boy without firing his weapon? . 'A study published in 2014 found that police officers, 'despite being better versed in dealing with criminal suspects, overestimated the age of Black and Latino child crime suspects. White children, on the other hand, were not subjected to such overestimations. . 'We need to be cautious about applying research like this to specific situations like the shootings being discussed. But the fact research shows how police officers might overestimate the age of non-White suspects suggests that officers might perceive more significant threats in the moment than really exist.\nThe post-Floyd reckoning in the media has emphasized the need for journalists to look skeptically at claims from police and other officials following a killing, as they may come undone when more facts come to light. 'Shortly after the March 29 death of Toledo, a Cook County prosecutor claimed that Toledo was shot while holding a gun in his right hand. But body camera footage released on Thursday suggests this claim was inaccurate, as it appears to show the boy unarmed and with his hands raised when he was shot. Officials also described the incident as an 'armed confrontation,  without noting that Toledo had complied with officer instructions to drop the firearm and put his hands up.\nJustice for Adam Toledo requires investments in our Black and brown communities and disinvestments in policing. One would be a proposal by the Chicago-based, Black youth-led GoodKids MadCity collective called the Peace Book, which would create neighborhood peace commissions with resources sufficient to meet community needs. The resources include funds for positive youth spaces, political and art education, mental health treatment, restorative justice, and conflict resolution services. The Peace Book could operate with a diversion of just 2 percent, or $35 million, from the CPD's budget. 'Second, the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance, sponsored by Chicago Democratic Socialist Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and backed by a diverse, citywide coalition, would prohibit CPD officers from responding to people in mental health crises and instead fund community-based mental health professionals. Similar programs in Oregon both reduce police violence and better serve community needs.\nAt a young age, Adam was categorized as a special education student and separated from everyone else at school. Surrounded by the same six students with varying degrees of severe learning disabilities, Adam didn't have the chance to develop strong friendships with any of his classmates. 'According to one teacher 'It was clear he needed someone to talk to and the space to socialize himself better. He really liked to draw, his penmanship was perfect. I think if we offered an art class, he would've taken it, but we don't even offer that to our students. He just needed one friend, one classmate or one other student he could connect with'. 'Defunding the police' means providing us with adequate funding for after-school programming, violence prevention initiatives, creative arts curricula and workforce development opportunities. Chicago, known across the world as 'Chiraq,  has fostered street gang culture for more than a half century. I was 15 years old the first time a gang member gave me a pistol. As children, we normalize gun violence to the degree of no longer flinching at the sound of gunshots. Adam Toledo did not deserve to be killed by Chicago police. He, like many children from our side of the city, deserves more."

        "document": "More than a quarter of all birds have vanished from the United States since 1970, a loss of nearly 3 billion animals. Over the past decade, 467 species were declared extinct. These extinctions were driven by habitat loss, overfishing, competition from invasive species, and climate change. 'Trees are an important bulwark against climate change, cooling the air around them, capturing and storing carbon, supporting other species, and cycling moisture. . . A research team last year found that helping forests recover and regenerate could soak up a large share of all the greenhouse gas emissions humanity has ever produced. Yet the world also received a shocking glimpse in the past year of how vulnerable even the mightiest forests can be. The Amazon rainforest, the world's largest tropical forest, suffered its highest rate of decline in more than a decade in 2019 driven by logging, mining, and agriculture.\nIt's startling to recall just how dirty America was in 1970. Rust Belt cities (which hadn't yet fully rusted) suffered air-pollution levels comparable to Beijing's in recent years; Los Angeles and smog were synonymous. The air in Mobile, Alabama, was so bad that it was costing people almost four years of their lives. So it wasn't hard to get people marching: estimates of participation in that first glorious Earth day run at twenty million, or ten per cent of the American population at the time. All that marching worked: the shift in the Zeitgeist forced Richard Nixon to sign one law after another, from the Clean Water Act to the Endangered Species Act. And those laws worked: air pollution has dropped by more than sixty per cent across America since 1970, and life expectancy has grown by 1. 5 years on average as a result. 'But after 1970, we chose to do the easy and obvious stuff, and we didn't transform our systemsor our outlooksin fundamental ways. Instead of pollution that you can see (and smell), in this century we're increasingly dealing with what the President might call an 'invisible enemy': the carbon-dioxide molecule. This time, there's no easy technical fix, just turning off the fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy. But that means turning off the giant companies that dominate the hydrocarbon economy. That's not an argument about sciencethat's a fight about power.\nEnvironmental writer Emma Marris states that 'It was British Petroleum that first popularized the individual carbon footprint calculator, because it really puts all of the burden and guilt about solving climate change on the individual consumer's shoulders. take the hours that you spend now feeling guilty and reallocate them to collective action. You might not change fossil fuel policy for the entire United States, but you might get a cool bike lane put in your city that encourages a lot more people to take that option to commute. It's so easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the complexities of this extremely wicked problem. And that's why we all need to do a division of labor and collective action. That's the only thing that's going to get it done.\nThe IRENA group's Global Renewables Outlook concludes that greater investment in green energy would improve the cumulative gross domestic product by $98 trillion by 2050 and bring with it 42 million jobs. The return on investment: $3 to $8 for every $1 invested. The report also found that the same capital would cut CO2 emissions by 70% by 2050; renewables would replace fossil fuels used for both the industrial and transport sectors.\nA cooler planet with more livable cities and healthier ecosystems will be in a stronger position to fight public health emergencies, especially where contagions are involved. And a better organized and funded public health system will be more equipped to address the next hurricane or flood that leaves cities and rural areas alike confronting death and disease, especially in low-income populations. Finally, with an economy in free fall, we need to put people back to work, as soon as it is safe. The U. S. clean energy industry---in companies large and small---is a smart place to focus. China has made that bet, and we should as well, if only to strengthen U. S. competitiveness."

        "document": "By 1970, many leading environmentalists were predicting the end of the world. Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich was perhaps the leading apocalypse proponent. For Earth Day, he predicted that environmental deterioration would kill 65 million Americans, and that globally, 4 billion would die before the year 2000. Not only were these predictions spectacularly wrong, but they were outlandish when first made. Yet in a world where more alarm gets more attention, they started a trend of framing environmental issues in worst-case ways. The tone scares, it depresses---and it likely skews our focus and spending.\nThe progress of economies around the world shows that environmental quality and economic prosperity go hand in hand---they are allies, not enemies. Numerous studies show that once GDP per capita reaches a certain threshold, pollution begins to plummet. Human well-being is essential to responsible care for the environment, not the other way around. The best long-term solution for our environment is to promote freedom and economic growth. 'Over the last 50 years, the United States has dramatically reduced emissions of the six key pollutants that harm human health. Lead, ozone, carbon monoxide, and other harmful airborne substances have declined by 74%---all while our economy, population, vehicle miles traveled, and energy consumption have skyrocketed. Our cities are no longer shrouded by smog and toxic fumes, despite our dramatic growth. Our unprecedented environmental successes came not at the hands of big-government programs or stifling economic growth, but rather through a careful balance of reasonable, predictable regulations and free market innovation.\nThe U. S is itself only responsible for 14 percent of global emissions. To resolve a global challenge like atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations would require more international coordination and compliance than our present geopolitics would suggest is possible. If we cannot trust the Chinese Communist Party to relay critical epidemiological information, such as the virus's genetic sequence or even the number of deaths it has caused, why should we trust it, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to enforce emissions policies detrimental to the sectors that have enabled the country's economic ascent?\nSome ask, 'When did Republicans stop leading on environmental issues? Ours is the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who championed the protection of public lands; of Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the U. S. Forest Service (and later the governor of Pennsylvania); and Richard Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency. 'I continue to support policies that embrace all sources of energy, including natural gas, which has lowered our dependence on coal. I also support nuclear power, the largest around-the-clock provider of carbon-free energy. Yet many of my conservative friends have been reluctant to join me in supporting renewable technologies such as wind and solar. These and other advancements not only address dangerous greenhouse-gas emissions, but also are helping improve our economy with new jobs.\nEnvironmental policy technologist Matt Frost states, 'I don't think there's going to be any radical discontinuity in how humans choose to organize their lives and how they choose to make their lives more comfortable. I think that our policy emphasis should be on technology breakthroughs. We should be funding carbon capture research and bringing the price on that down. 'And I do think that cheap, clean, energy is something that---especially as the people in the developing world become wealthier---is tremendously popular. Energy is the primal commodity. And so an energy breakthrough is something that we should be pushing and wishing for on a popular level and funding from a policy level---just as much as if we were in the 70s. An energy breakthrough is absolutely where a lot of human imagination and engineering talent and resources should be devoted."

        "document": "Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority, and also win tie votes because they hold the vice presidency. That means they have majorities in every committee, and they schedule final confirmation votes for every nominee who clears those committees. To be sure, Democrats can still stall this procedure. for two hours. Trump's complaint is entirely untrue: Democrats aren't blocking his executive-branch nominees. Of the 750 or so most important positions needing Senate confirmation, only 82 are currently under consideration. Of those, only a small number have been cleared by committee and are awaiting a floor vote. A much larger group, 165 in all, are still open because Trump hasn't nominated anyone. 'Despite what the president says, that's not a lot of current nominees before the Senate by historical standards. And of course some of them were just recently nominated. All the rest are in limbo because of either Republican opposition or Republican indifference. Trump's grievance, to the extent he has one, is with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans. Not Democrats.\nOn its face, Trump's argument for doing this is absurd. The compliant Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed most nominees this president has put forth. Yet some of the most critical positions in the government---including the secretary and deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security---remain without a confirmed official in place to this day not because of Senate dawdling but because the president hasn't gotten around to making a selection. Indeed, Trump has said that he likes having senior roles in government filled by acting officials, who may be more eager to please him. In the middle of a pandemic and with the economy in a tailspin, it is a dereliction of presidential duty to have left the government so woefully understaffed.\nMoreover, 'Despite Trump's claim that he has a 'very strong power' to adjourn Congress, this power is actually quite limited. The Constitution provides that the president may adjourn both houses of Congress 'to such Time as he shall think proper,  but only 'in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.  Thus, the president's power to adjourn Congress is only triggered when the two houses disagree about when to adjourn. right now the House and Senate are in agreement about when to adjourn---they plan to formally adjourn on January 3, 2021. 'All of that said, if McConnell were determined to engineer a situation where Trump could make recess appointments, he could most likely do so. Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that Trump succeeds in adjourning the Senate. Then what? The most likely answer is that Trump would have to keep Congress out of session for a decent amount of time. Democratic political operatives couldn't dream of a more damaging story to tell about Trump during a presidential election year. The president is threatening to delay stimulus legislation, relief for many people who are unemployed, and potentially funding for necessary public health measures, over a petty dispute about a few political job vacancies.\nThe Senate is holding formal sessions every few days. Those formal sessions mean that the Senate is not in recess and that President Trump cannot use the recess-appointment power to unilaterally make appointments. This, by the way, is exactly what the Senate did during President Barack Obama's term to prevent him from making his own recess appointments. And in 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the Senate's power to do that. 'All this talk of adjournments and recesses may sound technical. But many important principles of constitutional law are embodied in constitutional fine print. Most obviously, a president cannot just make Congress disappear when he wishesin order to end an oversight investigation, for instance, or to prevent Congress from voting against a war he would like to wage. As for the question of staffing the government, the Supreme Court explained in its 2014 decision that the primary method prescribed by the Constitution for appointing officers of the United Statesincluding the attorney general, Supreme Court justices, and more than 1, 000 other varied jobsis presidential nomination plus Senate confirmation. The president generally can't just cut Congress out of the picture."

        "document": "Democrats have proclaimed themselves 'The Resistance' and made Trump's governance as difficult as possible, exalting their political ambition to portray him as illegitimate over the country's need for a functioning government. They have slowed appointments to a crawl by forcing the Senate to take 144 cloture votes on executive-branch nominations, with all the extended debate and chewing up of Senate session days that this entails. As the Heritage Foundation's Hans von Spakovsky and John G. Malcolm point out, the Senate took only 30 such cloture votes during the first term of the preceding nine presidents combined. 'Unfortunately, the only ways to beat back such intransigence are political: If the public is outraged enough, it must punish Democrats at the ballot box; or congressional Republicans must play the kind of hardball that makes Democrats feel there is too high a price to be paid. Neither of these is very likely---and the latter is in many ways self-defeating. Nevertheless, the president has no legal basis to adjourn Congress and make recess appointments.\nLike ending debate, confirming a nomination can be done quickly or slowly. Unanimous consent or a voice vote do not require the presence of all senators and can take a minute or two. If the minority refuses, however, the only option is a formal recorded vote that does require the presence of all senators and takes, on average, 35 minutes or more. The Senate took 173 recorded confirmation votes on executive branch nominations during the first term of the previous five presidents, Ronald Reagan through Obama. So far, the Senate has been forced to take 179 recorded confirmation votes, and Trump's four-year term has almost nine months to go. 'This outward example of the anti-Trump 'resistance movement' has had another debilitating consequence: It has resulted in scores of qualified nominees pulling out of the process because of long delays and frustration, or otherwise good people declining to be nominated because it likely would not result in a confirmation. The Democrats' resistance tactics have hampered the work of the entire executive branch and also affected key agencies during the present coronavirus crisis.\nAt the same time, 'Imagine how absurd it would be if the president could force Congress to adjourn at will. He'd be able to fill vacancies with recess appointments anytime he liked, provided, I guess, that he could convince the courts that it was an 'extraordinary occasion. . The Senate could willingly hand him that authority by moving to adjourn and then squabbling with the House over the duration of the adjournment, but Trump can't seize it. And if you don't like that, imagine President Joe Biden trying it and see how much you like it then. 'If Trump wants to speed things up on the Senate rubber-stamping his judges, why doesn't he call on them publicly to approve remote voting by senators? That would be politically popular and it would move the judicial conveyor belt along.\nAs it stands, the president first has to force a disagreement over the date of adjournment, use this unprecedented power to order adjournment, place the houses in recess, and then use the recess to trigger his authority to make unilateral appointments. Moreover, the Senate would not only have to cooperate in a scheme to nullify its own authority but it would likely have to torch long-standing rules governing things like cloture to end debate---rules designed to protect minority interests in what Senators like to call 'the world's greatest deliberative body.  That daisy-chained strategy can break easily at various critical points. None of this needs to happen. This is a dormant provision that should be left in well-earned slumber.\nSome, however, argue that 'We should feel no sympathy for Congress. The House pretends to be open for the sake of preventing recess appointments. Yet as things stand, because neither chamber is actually meeting in any real sense, nothing can pass. Hence the Senate is in a de facto recess. Under current rules, when legislators go home, we have a Potemkin Congress. If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to cooperate, the Senate should agree to adjourn for 10 days or more. If after a few days the House refused to pass an adjournment resolution, Mr. Trump could cite the disagreement and adjourn Congress and make recess appointments."

        "document": "Critics like to point to human land-use practices as the cause. But they cannot explain the devastating infernos of the past decadethese would not be possible without human-driven climate change. Last year's National Climate Assessment made clear that climate change played a greater role in the observed increasing extent of these wildfires than land management or fire suppression efforts. 'In the Western US, climate change has increased the risk of fire weather fivefold and has doubled how much land has burned. Wildfire frequency has quadrupled since the 1980s, and fire season has lengthened by more than two months (78 days). While any number of factors (lightning, a discarded cigarette, a campfire, or faulty power line) may ignite a fire, it's the underlying environment that matters once a fire starts. Without solving the problem at its source, the fires will only continue to rage bigger and spread further.\nA kind of toxic debt is embedded in much of the infrastructure that America built during the 20th century. For decades, corporate executives, as well as city, county, state, and federal officials, not to mention voters, have decided against doing the routine maintenance and deeper upgrades to ensure that electrical systems, roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure can function properly under a range of conditions. Kicking the can down the road like this is often seen as the profit-maximizing or politically expedient option. But it's really borrowing against the future, without putting that debt on the books. 'Climate change is calling in the debt on America's infrastructure. The blackouts are already costing Californians billions of dollars. The status quo has been revealed to be expensive, as it will be elsewhere. When the true costs are calculated, more radical solutions will start to seem practical, even obviouswhich is good, because we need them.\nIt is the 21st century now, the century of the climate change crisis, and the giant machine that was built to distribute electricity---a system of exposed overhead power lines that travel hundreds of miles over land---is more and more vulnerable to the rise in extreme weather. The imperative now is to reduce dependence on that increasingly brittle system, to strengthen the resilience and independence of local communities by enabling them to generate, store, and manage more of their own power. 'Good distribution-level planning will create microgrids within microgrids, each able to island from the level above, so that the system is more modular and less vulnerable to single points of failure. It will tie together solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electric vehicle chargers with smart controls and software. It will bring economic development, jobs, and innovation to local communities. And a bottom-up energy system will complement and ease the pressure on California's increasingly shaky and vulnerable top-down system. 'But it is only possible if utilities become partners in the effort. That will require fundamental change in the regulatory structure now governing PG&E, to bring its financial interests in sync with the social, environmental, and economic interests of California communities.\nIs PG&E too big? Probably. Is there not enough money? Definitely. Is there a massive failure of operations? Obviously. Are more people dying every year and losing everything they have? Yes. Newsom has expressed interest in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway making a bid for PG&E. Right now, it's hard to imagine anyone doing a worse job of running PG&E than PG&E has done. It probably makes sense to put the company under some kind of new management. 'But that won't fix the fact that policies that are supposed to govern the entity haven't worked. And it potentially could keep the decision-making of how to clean up this mess off the governor's desk. PG&E may be a villain to Californians in this case, but for leaders who don't want to be responsible for blackouts affecting millions, they're also a convenient one.\nSome critics note that 'If we redesigned our cities for the modern world, they'd be taller and less stretched out into the fire-prone far reaches---what scientists call the wildland-urban interface. Housing would be affordable because there'd be more of it. You'd be able to get around more cheaply because we'd ditch cars and turn to buses and trains and other ways we know how to move around a lot of people at high speeds, for low prices. 'But the big things still seem impossible here. In a state where 40 years ago, homeowners passed a constitutional amendment enshrining their demands for low property taxes forever, where every initiative at increasing density still seems to fail, where vital resources like electricity are managed by unscrupulous corporations and where cars are still far and away the most beloved way to get around, it's hard to imagine systemic change happening anytime soon. And so we muddle on toward the end. All the leaves are burned and the sky is gray. California, as it's currently designed, will not survive the coming climate. Either we alter how we live here, or many of us won't live here anymore."

        "document": "Democrats for years have treated PG&E as their de facto political subsidiary. The wildfires and blackouts are the direct result of their mismanagement. For instance, the Legislature in 2015 mandated that utilities spend $100 million annually on solar systems in low-income communities. This is on top of the $2. 2 billion in customer rebates for rooftop solar installations. 'Last year PG&E invested more than $150 million in battery storage and 'sustainable' technologies, which was paid for by a special charge on ratepayers. PG&E is also spending $130 million over three years to install 7, 500 electric-car charging stations and offers drivers a $800 'clean fuel' rebate. All of this has been part of a Democratic political strategy to use PG&E to advance their climate agenda without raising taxes. But Californians have instead paid through higher electric ratesPG&E rates are twice as high as in Oregon and Washington.\nThe same California that has boldly committed to transitioning to 50 percent renewable energy by 2025---and 100 percent renewable energy by 2045---can't manage its existing energy infrastructure. The same California that has pushed its electricity rates to the highest in the contiguous United States through its mandates and regulations doesn't provide continuous access to that overpriced electricity. 'The state could have, if it wanted, pushed the utilities to focus on the resilience and safety of its current infrastructure---implicated in some of the state's most fearsome recent fires---as a top priority. Instead, the commission forced costly renewable-energy initiatives on the utilities. In 2016, then-governor Jerry Brown actually vetoed a bill that had unanimously passed the state legislature to promote the clearing of trees dangerously close to power lines. Brown's team says this legislation was no big deal, but one progressive watchdog called the bill 'neither insignificant or small. \nBetween the drought and the bugs, millions of trees diedtrees that had to be left in place because regulators, environmentalists, and politicians couldn't muster the will to permit harvesting or clearing before they became worthless and deadly matchsticks. In 2012, the Forest Service estimated that 77 million acres, mostly in the West, was at risk due to insects and disease. 'Meanwhile, PG&E is struggling to find the qualified crews to do the dangerous work of clearing trees from almost 2, 500 miles of powerlines across the vast northern reaches of the state. That isn't surprising, given that California and federal regulators armed with anti-logging policies put most of those people in the unemployment line, and they've moved on to other jobs or even states. 'Chuck DeVore, The Federalist\nBecause California accounts for less than 1% of global emissions, nothing it does will make a difference to climate, but its ratepayers shell out billions for wind and solar that might be better spent on fireproofing. A generation of ill-judged environmental activism has all but ended forest management in favor of letting dead trees and underbrush build up because it's more 'natural'. An activist state Supreme Court imposed on utilities responsibility for any wildfires started by their equipment regardless of negligence. At the same time, state policy obliges them to extend their networks to support housing developments in areas the state designates as 'very high fire risk'. 'Entrenched one-party government has given California's political class too much incentive to cater to the perpetual, year-round, full-time priorities of public-sector unions, green groups and the organized academic left rather than care about the quality of life for the average person in the state.\nCould climate change be the reason for excessive winds and dry weather? Of course. But. it matters little that the governor is'committed to addressing climate change' when he's not committed to preventing forest fires. California is dry. Not from climate change but from poor water management. Earlier this year the Sierra Nevada snowpack was 202 percent above the average (probably caused by climate change) with ski slopes operating into July. Where did the melt go? It is diverted, and California's waterways do not run naturally. So much so that a proposal was introduced in 2010 to allow at least 60 percent of the rivers to flow unencumbered. Last year that was reduced to 40 percent, and the policy has still not been implemented. California doesn't lack water; it lacks flowing water.\nSome posit that 'The technological answer to the risk from exposed power lines is the power lines should instead be buried beneath the surface. We are fully capable of providing an electricity grid year-round without burning down half the countryside. Other places in other countries manage it without problems. It is, though, more expensive. PG&E has asked for permission to charge higher rates so that it can clear the paths of those lines, replace old posts, and generally maintain the system better. They've also been told, so far at least, that they can't have them. California will keep burning until we accept higher prices for electricity."

Yet did the committee offer a damning look at President Trump's scheme to stay in office after losing the 2020 election? Also yes. Fresh video of the riot is a reminder that Jan. 6 was a brutal melee of fists and chemical sprays.\nThe committee calls Jan. 6 an 'attempted coup.  That makes it seem as if there was a chance of success. There wasn't. It was an impossible plan hatched by screwballs, and it would have gone down as such if the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers hadn't breached the Capitol.\nOne irony is that the largely Democratic committee's evidence makes clear that Mr. Trump's designs on overturning the election were foiled mainly by Republicans, including many in his Administration. White House lawyers threatened to resign if he fired Justice Department officials who didn't indulge his fraud theories. GOP state legislators refused to name new electors. His judicial appointees rejected dubious fraud claims. Above all, his own Vice President stood up to Mr. Trump's public and private pressure not to count electoral votes.\nFormer Attorney General William Barr compellingly explained that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Barr's solid account---based on facts and the law, and coming from a top Trump official who wanted the president to be reelected---would not have been impeached if Representatives Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, whom House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to appoint, had been seated on the committee and permitted to cross-examine Barr.\nConsequently, the testimony would have been more powerful: The opportunity to challenge Barr's account would have lent fact-finding integrity to the hearing, and the inability to shake his account would have enhanced our confidence that the hearing was getting to the truth. That is how real investigations and hearings work: They are adversarial proceedings. Alas, Pelosi chose not to play ball with McCarthy, turning the committee into an exercise in partisan theater, instead.\nDemocrats themselves used some very questionable legal pretexts to try to overturn a presidential election they lost in 2000 and insisted that the 2016 election was illegitimate. They will sometimes concede that their recent tolerance of political violence and their two decades of election rejection are a problem because they give Trump partisans a talking point, but that isn't nearly enough.\nIt's not just that you can't go from 'rioting is social justice' in July to 'riots are sedition' in January---it's that you shouldn't be starting from 'rioting is social justice' in the first place, and, if you are, you have already lost the game. The fact that Republicans have cynical, self-serving reasons for not taking the Democrats seriously does not erase the fact that there are excellent reasons for not taking the Democrats seriously.\nInstead of self-examination, Democrats offer: 'I don't get why these Republicans are so radical and angry, and, also, everybody who retweets a joke I don't like should lose his job'. And if these hearings go nowhere, which is likely, and if Democrats get pulverized in November, which also is likely, what are Democrats going to say? 'We just didn't realize how racist this country really is!  Because racism is why thinking people don't want Elizabeth Warren, the whitest woman since Eunice Wentworth Howell, in charge of writing our laws."

Barr said Trump actually did better there in 2020 than in 2016.\nThe concerns of a truck driver that he had delivered fraudulent ballots were investigated and dismissed. Misleading video shared online from Georgia was not of a suitcase of fraudulent ballots, but rather the normally used lockbox. Dominion voting machines were not fraudulent. Barr said 'idiotic claims' had been made in a sensational way to influence people.\nTrump's former campaign manager Bill Stepien described Trumpworld as being divided after the election was called, between 'Team Normal'---those who accepted the result of the election---and those aligned with former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani's efforts to overturn the election.\nEric Herschmann, a Trump White House lawyer who defended the former president on the Senate floor during the first impeachment and another member of 'Team Normal,  bluntly told the committee during his interview, 'What they were proposing, I thought was nuts.  He added, 'I mean, it was a combination of Italians, Germans, I mean, different things floating around as to who was involved. Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelans. something with the Philippines, just all over the radar. . Barr, along with other administration officials, described playing 'whack-a-mole' with Trump's false claims of fraud.\nAgain and again, reality was presented to him, but Trump acted as if it did not exist. Is this because he cannot recognize reality or because he doesn't want to recognize reality for assorted transactional purposes? So far, the committee has not provided an authoritative answer. But that may be above its pay grade.\nIn any event, there is a fundamental truth that transcends resolution of this issue: Whether or not Trump believes in his Big Lie, he has successfully encouraged millions of Americans to do so, and that includes the thousands who assaulted the Capitol on January 6. In either case, Trump is a threat to the republic.\nThe committee heard Monday from a cavalcade of former officials who worked for President Donald Trump around the time of the 2020 election. They all wanted Mr. Trump to win. Yet they all testified that they were confident that the election was not stolen and that they told Mr. Trump so.\nAnyone in Trumpworld with a shred of intellectual honesty apparently concluded that the claims of Mr. Trump and other 2020 crackpots were obviously false---'bull---t,  as former attorney general William P. Barr put it. The lesson is that, in the age of social media and hyper-partisanship, it is unsettlingly easy to manufacture national crises out of absolutely nothing.\nAmericans have long had the luxury of voting for leaders based on day-to-day issues such as economic performance or tax, education or environmental policy, because the major parties' nominees have shared commitments to basic facts and to the U. S. political system. We no longer have that luxury. Voters must now prioritize honesty on core issues and commitment to democracy above all else. If we fail to repudiate politicians who lie or who amplify lies about U. S. democracy, more will do so. Whether we have another 2020---or worse---in 2024 depends heavily on what voters do this November."

Democrats should certainly push for better terms (extending the enhanced unemployment benefits beyond four months, or tying them to some objective measure of labor-market conditions such as the unemployment rate, seems like an especially worthwhile place to push). But it's not clear to me how Democrats end up with a much better deal than this. 'If they do not sweep the Georgia Senate election runoffs in January, then Mitch McConnell will still control the Senate when Biden takes office, while Nancy Pelosi will preside over a much slimmer House majority than she does now. I see little basis for believing that Democrats will be able to get better terms from this new Congress than they have from the current one. 'More important, America's most vulnerable cannot wait two months for aid. And from a macroeconomic perspective, an ounce of recession prevention is worth a pound of cure. If America enters a recessionary spiral---with job losses leading to lower consumer spending, leading to more job losses---the fiscal cost of helping every constituency that Democrats wish to aid will rise substantially.\nProbably the most controversial aspect of the proposal is its omission of another round of direct payments to households, though this is defensible given its inclusion of $26 billion in additional nutritional aid for low-income families. Imperfect as it is, the bipartisan proposal merits support both in substantive terms and political ones. 'Substantively, it is better---much better---than nothing, which is what the 10 million who remain jobless, and the 26 million facing food insecurity, are getting now. Politically, it shows the way to yes for the negotiators, Mr. Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ), and puts pressure on them to get there. Things might have been easier if Ms. Pelosi had shown more flexibility before the election; they'd be easier now if Mr. McConnell would budge from his maximum of $500 billion and if Mr. Trump would press for legislation instead of ranting about vote fraud. Cooler heads must prevail lest eight months of hard-won economic progress be allowed to unravel.\nCritics of the bill, however, posit that 'Unable to pass the federal liability shield legislation on its own, lawmakers from both parties have now come together in a grand show of post-election bipartisan unity to help their corporate donors create a hostage situation that's something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie. Their proposal predicates long overdue and desperately needed unemployment assistance on the condition that corporations are given a get-out-of-jail-free card. corporate managers were allegedly betting on the number of COVID deaths that would happen at a meatpacking plant. 'With liability shields, those same employers will know that they can get away with all kinds of cost-slashing and corner-cutting that endangers workers and denies them access to basic protective gear. In other words, corporations will know they can drive the COVID body count ever higher, and they won't even have to worry about being called into a courtroom to answer for their crimes. 'The shield would strip frontline workers of their last remaining legal tool to protect themselves in the workplace---at the same that time the unemployment system is designed to financially punish those workers if they refuse to return to unsafe workplaces during the pandemic.\nComing in at just over $900 billion, the bipartisan proposal moved substantially away from what Democrats want (around $2 trillion) and a whole lot closer to what Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) has pushed for (around $500 billion). Naturally, the Senate majority leader responded to this dramatic move in his direction by immediately announcing that this compromise is a non-starter. 'By reaching this agreement with Republicans, a group of Democratic senators made it easier for McConnell to demand that they move still further in his direction once he tries to jam them with his proposal in the upcoming funding bill. Now the 'compromise' position has moved to a point between $900 billion and $500 billion. Which raises a question: Is there any serious utility at all in Democratic senators seeking compromise with Republicans, even ones who appear to be acting in good faith, if there's simply no chance that it will meaningfully influence McConnell, and if it's preordained that McConnell will simply seize on this to his tactical advantage?"

It is renewing many problematic programs fueled by the belief, I am sure, that the economy can stay on ice for months as long as it is sustained by government spending. I am sure the restaurants that benefited from PPP but have closed permanently have a different perspective on this issue. 'State revenues fell less than feared and are going up again. What's more, since 1975, the unemployment rate has averaged 6. 3 percent---it is forecast to be 6. 8 percent for November.

'Lastly 1. 7 percent of this bill---or $16 billion according to the COVID Framework document presented this morning---is specifically about manufacturing vaccines, distribution, and testing. If spending bills are a reflection of politicians' priorities, Americans are getting a clear signal that these politicians have incredibly messed-up priorities with very little focus on what should matter the most right now. This compromise is about business as usual. It's about spending money on the stuff politicians always want to spend money on. The fact that some Democrats are willing to spend less than they wanted and that Republicans are willing to spend more than they should is not noble. It's politics."

        "document": "'Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.  Those are the damning words of President Trump's handpicked ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who on Wednesday morning directly implicated not only Mr. Trump, but also several top members of his administration. 'Mr. Trump claims that he did nothing wrong, yet the White House refuses to let most of these people appear under oath. (Mr. Sondland himself defied orders not to testify from the White House and the State Department. ) It's worth emphasizing this point: All the witnesses whose testimony has been damaging to Mr. Trump have given that testimony under oath. All of those who we are led to believe would exonerate the president have so far refused to testify. If Mr. Trump truly believes he insisted on no conditions for the White House meeting and the aid for Ukraine, he has a clear choice: Let people testify. At this point it's hard to see what reason they have for continuing to refuse.\nThe president's defenders have leaned into a version of Nunes's argument that Trump was just very interested in rooting out Ukrainian corruption. According to this line of argument, Trump's interest onlycoincidentally happened to dovetail with an investigation of his possible chief political rival in the 2020 election and in a conspiracy theory that might damage the results of the Mueller investigation. Sondland's testimony, though, demonstrates that even if you wanted to accept this absurd premise, the evidence and testimony don't show Trump seeking any sort of genuine investigation. Instead, according to Sondland, he strictly wanted the announcement of one. 'As others in the impeachment inquiry have previously testified, if Trump actually wanted an investigation of corruption by American citizens, then the Department of Justice was the appropriate place for that to start. If the DOJ needed help from the Ukrainians to conduct such a legitimate investigation, they could request that help through what's called a mutual legal assistance treaty. None of that ever happened. Instead, there were secret back-channels and deals and demands. As we continue to learn, a legitimate investigation was never what Trump wanted. What he wanted was help in his reelection campaign, and he was willing to leverage America's national security to get it.\nZelensky 'had to announce the investigations,  Sondland said, referring to the probes into Biden's family and the 2016 election. 'He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it.  Legal experts previously told CNN that this is a critical distinction. Most legitimate investigations are done in secret, so as not to tip off the supposed criminals. But the intense focus on securing a public announcement from Zelensky demonstrates that the scheme was really designed to maximize the political benefit to Trump, instead of a good-faith effort to investigate corruption.\nThe GOP defense is now this: Trump is exonerated, because it hasn't yet been nailed down beyond any doubt that Trumpdirectly commanded Sondland to tell Ukraine that the money was withheld for that corrupt purpose. Sondland unequivocally confirmed that Trump was using the White House meeting as leverage to get the investigations he wanted, and that numerous top officials were in on that corrupt scheme. Now that it has been established that Trump dangled a meeting to force an investigation of Biden, how likely is it that Trump suddenly didn'tintend to use the frozen military aid for that same purpose, at precisely the moment he was bothobsessing over that goal and was maximizing his leverage over Ukraine to its highest point yet?\nThe hearings have demonstrated in detail the extent to which Trump conflates his personal grudges with America's interests, even when the former harms the latter, and how he allows those private grudges to dictate foreign policy decisions that impact multiple countries. A foreign policy driven by a person unwilling to govern his feelings, subordinate his grudges, or follow rules is not a policy at all. It's a puff of air, a set of whims. It's a vague hunch his yay-sayers must interpret and try to execute, and apologize for when he changes his mind and blames them for getting it wrong.\nThere are many pundits who will opine that removing a president is divisive and unprecedented. It is true that no president has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process. But that just speaks to how rare it has been for a president to even get to the point we are at now. And while it is certainly true that there are people who would be upset by his removal from office, the far greater risk lies in allowing this president, with this explicitly illegal, immoral and unjust track record of abusing the power of his office for his personal electoral benefit, to participate in future elections. Doing so would deprive the people of their constitutional right to choose their leader in a free, open and fair election."

        "document": "Polls show the vast majority of Americans agree with Vindman that the Trump-Zelensky call 'was inappropriate.  They agreed with Vindman before he testified. But only a minority of Americans say Trump's conduct warrants impeachment and removal. And the hearings are not changing their minds. Indeed, support for the impeachment inquiry has ticked down since the hearings began, as has the number of Americans tuning in to watch. That means Democrats are failing to convince Americans that Trump's misconduct rises to the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. In blackjack, the tie goes to the dealer; in impeachment, the tie goes to the president. If Republicans fight Democrats to a draw, Trump wins.\nDemocrats on the Intelligence Committee have spent the vast majority of their impeachment hearings trying to persuade voters that bureaucrats believe Donald Trump is impulsive, self-serving, and misguided---all of which is unsurprising, and completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. Fiona Hill ended up making a compelling case that she, and others, disapproved of the White House's haphazard handling of foreign policy. But she offered no evidence of 'bribery. . Everything we know now that matters we already knew when first reading the report of Trump's call with Volodymyr Zelensky. Either you believe Trump should be impeached for asking a foreign leader to investigate his opponent's son for corruption or you do not.\nNot one witness offered any direct evidence that President Trump did anything clearly impeachable. No one heard him order a quid pro quo, in which Ukraine would gin up 'dirt' on Joe Biden in exchange for US aid or a White House meeting. Not one offered a convincing reason why Trump's interest in having Ukraine probe potential corruption warrants impeachment, even if it was part of quid pro quo. Fact is, Ukrainians were involved in the 2016 election, particularly in the investigation into Paul Manafort. And payments to Biden's son Hunter by notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma do reek.\nThe claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election 'is supported by significant evidence. It includes public professions of support for Clinton and opposition to Trump by Ukrainian officials. It includes acknowledgments by Ukrainian investigators that their Obama administration counterparts encouraged them to investigate Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bolstering this theory is the fact that Ukrainian officials leaked information damaging to Manafort (a ledger of payments, possibly fabricated) that forced Manafort's ouster from the Trump campaign, triggering waves of negative publicity. 'A Ukrainian court, in late 2018, concluded that two Ukrainian officials meddled in the election. And in 2018 House testimony, Nellie Ohr---who worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign opposition research firm that produced the lurid and discredited Steele dossier---conceded that a pro-Clinton Ukrainian legislator was a Fusion informant. When Republicans and most Trump supporters refer to evidence of Ukrainian collusion in the 2016 election, it is this collusion theory that they are speaking about. This theory is in no way mutually exclusive with the finding that Russia hacked the DNC accounts---it has nothing to do with the hacking. There is nothing illogical in believing both that Russia hacked the Democrats and that Ukraine supported the Democrats.\nSome agree that 'the Democrats have their quid pro quo. Even if Trump never explicitly stated that military aid was dependent on Ukraine's investigations, Sondland said that 'everyone was in the loop' and acted under the impression that that was, in fact, the situation. Sondland seems to be making a calculated bet that Trump won't walk away from impeachment unscathed. Just look at how many times he's changed his story. First, he insisted that there was no quid pro quo. Then, he admitted he had actually communicated the quid pro quo. And now, Sondland is throwing the White House under the bus and claiming that he knew of but was powerless to stop a quid pro quo. Sondland's testimony proves that Trump's motivations were personal and that the president did put U. S. national security interests at risk for the sake of political gain.\nYet many argue that 'this isn't a quid pro quo that comes close to meeting the definition of bribery. It's another case of Mr. Trump's volatile policy-making based on personal impulse or prejudice, but it's not an impeachable offense. Sondland's account essentially confirms that Mr. Trump had a negative view of Ukraine, was reluctant to keep supplying U. S. aid, and asked Mr. Sondland and others to work with Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce that he was opening an anti-corruption probe. Democrats might have advanced their cause with hearings and a censure resolution. Instead, they have unleashed the dogs of impeachment without impeachable offenses."

But plenty of the cash is flowing to core American priorities: almost $12 billion in the latest round is for replenishing U. S. weapons stocks, and nearly $7 billion for U. S. troops in Europe.\nEconomist Timothy Ash wrote in November that Ukraine aid is 'an incredibly cost-effective investment,  burning up Russia's military power for a single-digit share of the Pentagon's annual budget, though Moscow is one of America's most formidable adversaries.\nMany of the same Republicans sneering at Mr. Zelensky will claim the U. S. needs to abandon Ukraine to focus on China. But Beijing and Moscow are working together to undermine the West. The best step the U. S. could take to deter another assault like Mr. Putin's is delivering to Ukraine more of the best long-range weapons, aircraft, missiles, tanks and other tools it needs to defeat the invasion.\nAt the same time, 'There is no end in sight for the war in Ukraine. If we're looking at $100 billion a year for as long as the war goes on, that could mean several hundred billion more dollars. Estimates for the costs of rebuilding Ukraine have ranged from $350 billion to $750 billion---and those estimates are only going to go higher.\nAnd yet, there has not been a real debate about whether we should be comfortable with that level of commitment, or, if so, how we should pay for it.\nThe national debt is at its highest level since World War II. If Mitch McConnell believes, as he has said, that the most important priority for Republicans in the defense budget is to deliver aid to Ukraine, he should say which aspects of the defense budget he views as being of lower priority, or identify cuts elsewhere in the budget to pay for it. If Democrats believe that funding Ukraine aid is critical, they should decide whether doing so is more important than protecting entitlements or advancing other spending priorities.\nSome argue, 'The most important challenge facing the United States, according to the leader of Senate Republicans, is shoveling more money to Ukraine? ! ? Not the massive crisis on America's southern border, which Washington has demonstrated no interest in solving. Not the drug abuse crisis (fentanyl) that is killing so many Americans. Not growing wealth inequality and related structural economic issues, which means that young people today are going to live materially worse lives than their parents. Not China, America's real geopolitical rival. Not rising crime.\nAll these things are happening in America, to Americans, but none of that matters to the Republican leadership as much as Ukraine. Let history show that while their own country fell apart, Republican leadership was more interested in this proxy war with Russia -- which, surprise! , ends up enriching defense contractors."

The Iranian mullahs, equally cheered by Russia's success and Ukraine's defeat, would have boldly announced that they had finally acquired nuclear weapons.\nBut none of this happened. Because Zelensky stayed in Kyiv. Zelensky came to Washington to thank Americans on behalf of Ukraine, but in truth, it is we who should be thanking them.\nWednesday sent a strong signal of commitment---material and political, Ukrainian and American. As such, the day provided a capstone to a year that began amid fear of a quick and complete Russian conquest but is ending in frustration for Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. Ukraine has lost territory, to be sure; but it has taken some back. The chances that it will emerge from war as a viable state are far greater than the chances Russia will swallow it. Ukraine did not capitulate in a matter of days, as Mr. Putin had planned, and the combat has been costly in blood and treasure for Russia as well as Ukraine.\nTo call this unexpected situation a miracle would not do justice to the courage and sacrifice of the Ukrainian people, led by Mr. Zelensky. Nor would it give due credit to the strategic choices the Biden administration and the United States' NATO allies made, none of which was foreordained, all of which were fraught with risk---and most of which have paid off. The U. S. commitment to Ukraine is costly  but much less costly than it would be to live in a world in which Mr. Putin makes the rules.\nIn his address to Congress, Zelensky said emphatically that he seeks 'absolute victory' over Russia, the same kind of triumph that President Franklin D. Roosevelt promised as the United States was entering World War II. 'The Ukrainian people will win, too, absolutely,  he said. Zelensky used the word 'victory' 11 times in his speech, and once during his remarks to reporters at the White House after his meeting with President Biden.\nTellingly, Biden didn't use the word a single time. Instead, he promised support for Ukraine's 'unbreakable determination. to choose their own path' and pledged: 'We will stay with you for as long as it takes. . At some point next year, the tension beneath the surface in this war summit will have to be addressed.

Ukrainian officials say they avoid striking civilian targets, though their cluster munition strikes reportedly killed eight in occupied Izium last year, according to Human Rights Watch. Russian cluster bomb attacks have damaged homes, hospitals, and schools, and killed more than 58 civilians at a crowded train station in April 2022. The unexploded ordnanceplus unmarked landmines across swaths of Ukrainian territorywill require expensive cleanup even without additional cluster munition supplies.\nIn a perfect world, we would ban all munitions. Differences between nations could be settled in a court or on a soccer field. But that world doesn't exist. A nation so pointlessly attacked as Ukraine should be able to do everything to defend itself. Americans would likely consider doing the same if we were attacked.\nOne nation, and one nation only, gets to determine whether to use cluster munitions on its land---Ukraine. Its interest in using these controversial weapons is to destroy the Russian invaders while minimizing the loss of its own citizens' lives. It will likely be as judicious as possible while inflicting as much damage on the enemy as possible. And Ukraine's defense minister has vowed not to use the munitions in Russia. Yes, Kyiv will live with the scars of war, but ultimately, these munitions will save Ukrainian lives.\nSome argue, 'the American response to Ukraine is entirely out of proportion for a country long acknowledged not to implicate core U. S. interests. It's also potentially catastrophic: Gradually escalating is all fun and games until a nose-bloodied and humiliated Putin lobs the first tactical nuke in Ukraine or launches a massive conventional strike on, say, Poland, and then the world as we know it comes to an end.\nAs the Biden administration conceded recently, one reason Washington is turning to gruesome cluster munitions to bolster Kiev is that America's military-industrial base isn't keeping up with the war's demandsitself a symptom of a generational, bipartisan abandonment of U. S. manufacturing. If the 'pittance' of a war in Ukraine is stretching the Pentagon's conventional stockpiles, imagine the industrial incapacity that a confrontation with China over Taiwan might reveal."

It is half a century since the US stopped bombing Laos, having dropped more than 2m tons of cluster munitions; decades on, people then unborn are still paying the price. On one estimate, it will take another 100 years to fully clear the country. This is the true cost of cluster munitions.\nThe argument is that, however significant the risks and long-term costs of using cluster bombs, civilians will pay a far higher price where Russian forces prevail. Cluster munitions are effective in combating dug-in ground troops, like the Russian forces along the vast frontline.\nBut the same, of course, could be said for chemical weapons, and the US rightly finished destroying its remaining stockpile of those on Friday. Efficacy is why bans on such arms are needed in the first place. Russia's use of them is not a reason to further drag down international norms.\nTo suggest that cluster bombs can be used discretely against military targets in Ukraine is an illusion. The lesson from Laos and the consensus of all nations who have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions is that there is no responsible use of cluster bombs. This consensus emerged out of intense research and study of the actual failure rates of cluster munitions in warfare. Any use of cluster bombs in Ukraine by any of the parties to the conflict will extend the human suffering well past the end of military hostilities.\nSome argue, 'Let's get real: Ukraine's democratically elected leaders, whose relatives, friends and neighbors are in the line of fire, are more mindful of minimizing Ukrainian casualties than are self-appointed humanitarians in the West watching the war on television. We need to respect their decision.\nCluster munitions remain a lawful instrument of warfare for countries that haven't signed the 2008 convention, and Kyiv has shown itself a responsible steward of all the Western weaponry it has received. Zelensky and his generals are, in fact, so worried about needless loss of life that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is progressing too slowly for the liking of some observers in the West. Unlike the Putin regime, the Zelensky government is not willing to butcher its own men in human-wave attacks. Using cluster munitions has the potential to save the lives of many Ukrainian soldiers."

Something that inflammatory showing up a few weeks before the election couldn't simply be dumped out to the public without checking into it. But people did check and have since found two people copied on some of the emails who verified their authenticity. Then they reported on it with that supporting testimony to back it up. 'If the FBI had found anything tying the laptop to the Russians we'd probably have heard about it by now. I'll even concede that it's still possible that some bad actors, be they foreign or domestic, could theoretically have been involved in making the contents of Hunter Biden's hard drive available as some sort of oppo project. 'But at the end of the day, the only real question is whether or not the emails are real and if they were composed by Hunter Biden. Neither Hunter nor his father's campaign has once tried to deny the authenticity of the emails. And the previously mentioned confirmation offered by other recipients of the messages pretty much seals the deal.\nEven if the information had been hacked, that would not make it inauthentic. The reason hacking is a serious offense that causes humiliation and wreaks financial and privacy havoc is because it exposes true information. The hacked Democratic National Committee emails were a problem for Democrats in 2016 because they were real. Media outlets published stories about them, and the Obama administration confronted the Russian regime over them, because the emails were authentic. Hacking is a bad thing. but there's nothing about it that makes the stolen information suspect. 'The Biden campaign's initial reaction was to check the former vice president's official calendar---after which the campaign first lamely said there was no notation of any such meeting, and then meekly admitted that Biden might well have met with the Burisma executive. But notice what they didn't say: Nobody claimed there was no need to check any official calendar because the email was a fake. They assumed it was authentic, because there was no good reason not to. At the moment, the known evidence overwhelmingly tends to establish that the laptop is exactly what it is represented to be: the repository of Hunter Biden's authentic emails, documents, photos and videos.\nAccording to the emails, both Bidens were in line in 2017 to benefit from a deal with CEFC. One email. refers to financial payments in terms of '20' for 'H' and '10 held by H for the big guy?  Fox News says it has confirmed the veracity of the email with one of its recipients and that sources say the 'big guy' is Joe Biden. 'Mr. Biden was a private citizen in 2017 but was considering a presidential run. A transaction that would have made himor his sonpartners with an entity tied to the Chinese government raises questions about judgment and how he would handle China as President. Joe Biden ought to clear the air on this China business in his own political interest. 'President Trump, as usual, is muddying the story with inappropriate demands that the Department of Justice investigate a potential crime. But the real burden here should be on Mr. Biden and the press. Perhaps Joe Biden wasn't involved, and Hunter was using his father's name to advance his own business interests. But it's also possible that Joe Biden was aware of the CEFC business and was unwilling to tell his son that he couldn't trade on his father's name and position. Whatever the truth, the public deserves better than Mr. Biden's Trump-like dismissal of the CBS reporter who so far is the only one brave enough to ask about the emails.\nDoes anyone remember the Trump-Russia investigation? There were news stories that characterized a handshake and a chat between a figure in the Trump circle and a Russian, such as Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as 'contacts with Russians' worthy of investigation. Robert Mueller's prosecutors investigated one such meet-and-greet moment at the 2016 Republican convention, taking testimony under oath from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Trump aide J. D. Gordon, and others. Prosecutors also questioned Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner about a handshake and chat with Kislyak. 'Now, when the Biden campaign allows that there might have been an 'informal' and 'cursory' encounter between Joe Biden and an executive from the corrupt Ukrainian company that was paying his son $50, 000 a month to do nearly nothing, much of the political world's reaction is not only to deny the story without investigating but to praise social media companies for banning it.\nNothing may be illegal here; voters can decide what to make of it. But it ought to register with you how cravenly some in the mainstream media are trying to convince you something isn't true that they know is true. The New York Post revelations are unlike many things you've seen reported as 'news' lately: There is meticulous, transparent sourcing. 'The technician who ended up in possession of Hunter's laptop is described in detail and has now been identified by name by other news outlets and even outed himself. The named persons of Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon vouched for how the data came into the Post's hands. Compare this to the vague, anonymous sourcing of so many Russia collusion stories or the New York Times's mysteriously sourced 'tax-return data' (not tax returns) of Donald Trump."

Like all slapdash political scandal stories, the New York Post's version leaves the reader with more questions than answers. 'Did the 'opportunity' turn into an actual meeting? What, precisely, was the role of Pozharskyi? What was he working on? What of the computer that the email was recovered from? (It was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop and supposedly belongs to Hunter Biden. ) And what did the New York Post know about all this? . 'Not enough to satisfy New York Post journalists, apparently. As reported by Katie Robertson of the New York Times, the story's main author, veteran staffer Bruce Golding, declined to attach his byline to the piece over credibility concerns, as did at least one colleague. According to the Times, one of the bylined authors---Gabrielle Fonrouge---learned that she'd been credited only after the story was published. The other by-line belongs to Emma-Jo Morris, who had no previous New York Post bylines.\nThe Biden campaign denied that any substantive meeting occurred between the then-vice president and claims that there are no records of it. Biden's foreign policy and energy advisers also said that they'd never heard of Pozharskyi; there's a possibility, perhaps, that the Ukrainian executive briefly met Biden at a public event, several of which were scheduled for the vice president on the day in question. (Hunter Biden had previously arranged for a potential business partner from China to shake hands with his father in the lobby of a Beijing hotel. ) But so far, it doesn't look like the meeting described in this email happened at all. 'There are also strong indicators that Russia had something to do with this whole affair, though nothing has surfaced definitively proving this is the case. In January, the same Russian intelligence unit that hacked Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic National Committee's emails in 2016 was also able to infiltrate Burisma's systems. 'U. S. intelligence analysts subsequently picked up chatter indicating that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked as part of an October surprise aimed at influencing the election. Analysts were further concerned that forged materials might be included in the leaksomething that, without the original materials in question, journalists can't verify for themselves, leaving everyone to take the New York Post's word.\nSo far, the Hunter Biden laptop affair is a farcical retread of the Russian hack-and-leak operation that helped torpedo Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations in 2016. Now, as then, the Trump campaign appears to be hoping that the media will dribble out stolen private messages over the final weeks of the campaign, creating an illusion of scandal where none exists. And now, as then, someone in Trump's inner circle is working directly with someone who is, at least according to the U. S. government, a Russian agent. 'The provenance of the alleged hard drive is murky, and the F. B. I. is reportedly investigating whether it's linked to a foreign disinformation campaign. Giuliani claims his lawyer got it from a Delaware computer repair shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, who says someone he thinks was Hunter Biden dropped off three laptops and never picked them up. Mac Isaac gave a halting interview to several journalists last week; The Daily Beast published the audio, so you can hear for yourself as his story shifts over the course of an hour. If there's an important story here, it's almost certainly about Giuliani's dirty tricks, not any wrongdoing by Joe Biden.\nWhat's clear, beyond the false scandal-mongering, has been evident for years: Hunter Biden made a mistake getting involved with a dubious company like Burisma. But the notion that the Burisma affair undermines Joe Biden's case to be president is, as he would say, malarkey. 'Joe Biden said in January it was a 'mistake' for his son to join the board, and promised that if he becomes president, none of his family members will have 'any involvement with any foreign government at all.  Hunter Biden, too, said he made a 'mistake' for which he bore 'full responsibility.  That's the sort of self-criticism we rarely hear from Trump or his family. This is smoke without a fire.\nMuch is unknown about the Trump family's business overseaspast and present. While serving in the White House, Ivanka obtained fast-track approval of trademarks in China for fashion gear, beauty services, and voting machines. (Yes, voting machines. ) She also received quick okays for trademarks in Japan. 'According to the New York Times, the tax records the paper unearthed reveal that Trump, in the first two years of his presidency, received millions of dollars from projects in foreign countries, including $1 million from Turkey, $3 million from the Philippines, and $2. 3 million from India. Has Trump been involved with those projects as president? Let's see all the emails. Last year, Donald Jr. visited Indonesia to work with a Indonesian billionaire on a hotel project for the family businessand declared there was no connection between this deal and his dad's foreign policy actions. (At one point, the project had Chinese financing. ) Let's see all the emails about this, too."

        "document": "Justice Gorsuch cites the High Court's Phillips (1971) ruling that held Title VII protects a woman not hired because she was a mother. But motherhood is inextricably linked to biological sex. Gender and sexual orientation are not. 'The good textualist is not a literalist,  Justice Scalia once wrote. The majority here isn't merely applying an overly broad or vague law, which Justice Gorsuch has criticized the Court for doing in other cases. The Court is redefining the original meaning of 'sex' in the law. 'If Justice Gorsuch can use textualism to rewrite a statute to comport with changing public mores, then it is meaningless. Textualism becomes merely one more tool of those who believe in a 'living Constitution' that means whatever any Justice says it means. Justice Gorsuch has defined his own jurisprudence down.\nFor decades, courts rightly interpreted 'sex' discrimination in Title VII as prohibiting employers from treating women worse than men because they are women and vice versa. Rewriting the law to include 'gender identity' as a protected status should be a power held solely by the legislative branch, and Congress has declined to make this change multiple times. The same is true about adding 'sexual orientation' to Title VII. Again, Congress has repeatedly rejected adding that classification to Title VII. 'This very point was recognized earlier in Zarda's litigation by Judge Gerard Lynch, an Obama appointee on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Lynch supports adding at least one LGBT classification to Title VII as a matter of policy. Yet he did not interpret the law that way, saying: 'I would be very pleased to awake to learn that Congress had secretly passed such legislation more than a half century agountil I actually woke up. Because we all know that Congress did no such thing. \nTo say that because sexual orientation is related to sex, it is the same thing as sex, is as nonsensical as saying that a square and a rectangle are the same thing for painting purposes because both have four sides. Laws should be interpreted according to the generally understood and understandable public meaning at the time they were adopted. Otherwise, the meaning of laws might change willy-nilly. All this is important because radically new interpretations of existing phrases can lead to unforeseen consequences. 'Alito outlined some of them in his dissent, including how this reading of 'sex' for employment purposes could also be used not just to allow but to mandate unisex locker rooms, the participation of men in women's sports leagues, and coed roommates in colleges or to make the use of an undesired personal pronoun a legally punishable offense. Gorsuch and company should never have approached this judicial Pandora's box. Implementing a social agenda, even an admirable one, is not a judge's job. As Alito wrote in his opening sentence, 'There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation. \nIn Harris, a funeral home had separate dress codes for men and women; a biological male (Stephens) began 'living as a woman' and was fired for dressing as a woman. Under Gorsuch's reasoning, this would qualify as sex discrimination because a woman would not be fired for dressing as a woman. But that assumes that the Court has decided whether Stephens is a woman, which of course is the entire question in debate in arguments about the legal and social status of transgenderism. 'The Harris Funeral Home enforced its dress code against Stephens not to discriminate against women dressing as women, but because it believed that Stephens was a man. Just as it did in Roe v. Wade (deciding who is a human) or Obergefell v. Hodges (deciding what is a marriage), the Court actually decided the most important question in the case without even admitting it was doing so.\nIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of this decision, and the size of the loss to religious and social conservatives. SCOTUS, the highest legal authority in the land, has declared that homosexuality and transgenderism are like race. If you disagree, you are on the side of Klansmen, in effect. This is not just the opinion of Democratic lawmakers, or columnists at The New York Times. This is now the law of the land. And it became the law of the land thanks to two Republican nominated justices. 'The last reason. why religious conservatives should grit their teeth and vote for Trump anyway has now been blasted to smithereens by this decision written by a Trump justice. And not just a Trump justice, but the paradigmatic Trump justice, the man whose place on the Supreme Court was meant to justify religious conservatives turning a blind eye to Trump's many other failures. This is what 'but Gorsuch' means. Those words are like ashes in the mouth today."

        "document": "A simple example illustrates why Gorsuch and the court were correct. Imagine an employee named Chris who never has met the employer. Chris and the employer had communicated by text and email, but never met in person or talked by phone. Chris often has referred to a husband in discussing evening or weekend plans. When Chris and the employer meet, the employer is surprised that Chris is male. The employer fires Chris, saying that he does not want to employ gay people. If Chris were female, Chris would still have the job. That, by definition, is employment discrimination because of sex.\nThe scope and thus the impact of this decision is hard to overstate, aside from the immediate protections it offers for 'approximately 1 million workers who identify as transgender and 7. 1 million lesbian, gay and bisexual workers'. Among other things, it will likely doom new proposed regulations from the Trump administration stripping health-care protections from transgender individuals, since it was explicitly based on Justice Alito's rejected interpretation of the language of discrimination according to sex. Politically, the fact that Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, wrote this decision could be ominous for the president.\nThe ruling is a bracing defeat for social conservatives, the Trump administration, and the conservative legal movement. Legal conservatives have long justified their support for Trump by citing his success at placing like-minded jurists on the federal bench, with Gorsuch as the foremost example of their victory. Monday's ruling suggests that the reliably conservative Supreme Court majority sought for so long by right-wing legal activists may not be quite as reliable as it seemsand that their moral and ethical sacrifices to pursue it may have been in vain.\nThis watershed ruling implicitly recognizes that rights such as gay marriage may ring hollow if one can be fired for exercising them. And it represents a historic judicial affirmation of the dignity and equality of transgender persons. 'Gorsuch simply accepts the experience and humanity of transgender people as a given, affirming their place in our society. Gorsuch does not hesitate in correctly referring to Aimee Stephens---the transgender plaintiff---as 'she.  This may seem like a simple gesture. Yet it stands as a towering rebuke of judges who have recently issued decisions that cruelly misgender transgender plaintiffs. Monday's victory is not just a triumph of textualism; it is a triumph of love and dignity.\nFor some time, overwhelming majorities of the American public have opposed job discrimination against LGBTQ people. According to data from the Public Religion Research Institute, not only did 72 percent of Americans in 2019 say they favored 'laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations, and housing,  that number included 61 percent of Republicans. 'All of which tells us that as a political matter, this question is pretty much settled. Of course, in theory the Supreme Court is supposed to ignore politics and simply rule on the law, but that's often not how it works---or at least, the law is only part of the story. The justices are well aware of public opinion, and while they might resist more at some times than others, they're capable of bending to political reality.\nSome posit that 'Justice Gorsuch's commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures---based on a wooden reading of the word 'operate. . 'The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions.\nIn a concurring opinion in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018), Gorsuch suggested that religious conservatives should enjoy sweeping exemptions from laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. And the Supreme Court is expected to hear a case next fall asking whether religious organizations have a broad right to engage in anti-LGBTQ discrimination. So the fate of individual LGBTQ workers remains unclear---at least for employees with bosses who object to LGBTQ people on religious grounds."

According to the poll, Trump would barely edge out Biden among white voters, 47% to 46%. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 20 points among white voters---and this was not unheard of. Mitt Romney beat the Obama-Biden ticket by 20 points among whites in 2012, and John McCain won whites by 12 points in 2008. 'Quinnipiac also found that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , would get within eight points of Trump among white voters. Not since 1996, when Bill Clinton came within two points of Bob Dole, has any Democrat come within single digits among whites. It's just hard to see Harris having the best performance among whites in 24 years running against Trump, who has built his successful electoral career around white identity politics.\nWe are 17 months away from the election. At this point in the 2016 election season, polls showed Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by huge margins. An Associated Press poll published on 10/25/16, two weeks before the election, gave the race to Clinton by 13 points, the same margin that Quinnipiac gives to Biden today.\nIowa Democratic voters have seen and heard much more from the contenders than almost any other state, and thus are much less likely to base their preferences largely on name identification. For Biden, that hasn't been a good thing. The state's ideological lean also hampers Biden. Sixty-eight percent of 2016 Democratic caucusgoers were liberals, according to the entrance poll. That's bad news for Biden, whose national lead rests on moderate voters. There are simply many fewer potential Biden voters in the state than there are in the nation as a whole. This places organization at a premium, as it is crucial for him to turn out every last potential vote. If Biden can't win in Iowa, he's unlikely to be able to catch up later.\nSome argue, 'The only Democratic candidate with real national stature is former Vice President Joe Biden. But Biden has always been a weak, self-destructive candidate and he is still a weak, self-destructive candidate. From defending the Chinese, to sniffing people's hair, to plagiarizing others, there is a 'Bidenness' that plagued his first two campaigns for president and will probably destroy this one. If Biden does fade---and recent Iowa polls certainly make this possible---the Democrats will have no national candidate.\nOthers contend, 'Biden's decision to change his position on the Hyde Amendment is actually something abortion supporters should welcome---because it is a tribute to the power they hold. Pro-lifers loved George H. W. Bush when he flip-flopped, and just look at the behavior of evangelicals in relation to Trump on social issues. Making converts out of politicians is what activism is all about. Punishing someone for joining you is politically insane, even for people who often seem politically insane. The truth is that Biden is running a nearly perfect campaign in the early going based on one implicit message: I can beat Trump, because I can speak to his voters and I'm not a crazy socialist like some of these other folks.\nStill others point out that 'a recent NPR/Marist poll finds only 18 percent support third-trimester abortion. Yet every Democratic senator running for president voted against a bill requiring doctors to help infants who survive a late-term abortion. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (N. Y. ) says there's no room in the party 'for a Democratic candidate who does not support women's full reproductive freedom.  That's slamming the door on a majority of voters. 'The Democratic contenders are espousing policies few Americans support and giving moderate and conservative members of their own party the cold shoulder. Democrats eyeing the White House need to get real. By writing off moderate and conservative members of their own party, they're boosting Trump's chances of reelection. Then again, Trump's reelection may be the gut punch that brings the Democratic party back to its senses."

Of course, a lot can change between now and November of next year. And in fairness to Trump, it is true that state-level polls underestimated his support in 2016. It's undeniable, however, that the 2020 polling, taken in its totality, doesn't look good for Trump right now.\nThe head-to-head polling doesn't really tell us much about events 18 months in the future, but it does tell us there's no counterintuitive process whereby Trump secures the votes of tons of people who say he's doing a bad job as president. The public is mostly saying they want to vote for any Democrat, and the strongest pattern so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than the more obscure ones. Rather than being either complacent or paralyzed by fear, Democrats should probably take a modest amount of reassurance from Trump's bad polls and try worrying about everything else for a minute.\nMany argue that, 'Biden is wrong to imply that if only Trump is gone, Republicans in Congress will immediately negotiate with a Democratic president in good faith. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) brags that he will continue to be the 'grim reaper' and destroy any legislation from a Democratic president, while promising to further pack the Supreme Court if a vacancy arises during an election year. Biden and Democratic candidates for the presidency, House and Senate should run against the hugely unpopular 'grim reaper' McConnell and the Trump Republicans in Washington.  Brent Budowsky, The Hill\nDoes Biden believe in his own powers of persuasion? Or is he attempting to woo prized Obama-to-Trump voters, not to mention upscale white suburbanites reported to be appalled by Trump's behavior? . . . But there's another crowd this stuff appeals to as well, a group that would rather not discuss the economic issues that contributed to Trump's victory. That would be the donor class of the Democratic Party. 'There's lots of evidence to suggest that Biden really does think he brings unique skills at bipartisanship to the presidential table. He did make deals with the Republicans aplenty in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. But they were deals like the Hyde Amendment and bankruptcy 'reform' that made life harder for people in financial trouble or struggling with student debt, though not for the wealthiest. If members of the Democratic donor class are putting their faith in Biden, it's hard to blame them. The real question is whether voters will continue to support Biden as it becomes clearer and clearer that his promise of bipartisanship is simply another, more politically palatable way of saying that the rich will continue to come first.  Helaine Olen, Washington Post\nRegarding Buttigieg's speech, some argue, 'He is an heir to Obama's cautious and intellectual worldviewexcept that while Obama was, at heart, a realist influenced by the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr and the actions of Brent Scowcroft, Buttigieg is more motivated by values. Buttigieg is, at heart, a liberal internationalist who is looking beyond interventions to challenges posed by great powers, bridging the gap between the Obama and Clinton wings of his party. He fears that, left untended, threats to liberty abroad will ultimately threaten liberty at home. Buttigieg still has a lot of work to do to unpack what this means, but if he sticks to it and is bolder than he was on Tuesday, he may be able to articulate the alternative he promised.\nOthers contend, 'Buttigieg wants to set a generous narrative of national identity against Trump's cramped and cruel vision, and against the progressive hostility to any national identity at all. It won't be easy. He speaks of the compassion of his Indiana neighbors toward refugees, their desire to be part of 'a greater project' than just America First. But the strongest political emotions of the moment are fear, disillusionment, and hatred. As impressive as he is personally, Buttigieg hasn't yet found the words, the music, and the policies to make his appeal convincing.  George Packer, The Atlantic"

        "document": "Juxtapose the treatment of an actual anti-Semitic attack by two black perpetrators affiliated with a black supremacist group with the media and Twitter Left's treatment of Donald Trump's executive order (EO) targeting anti-Semitism on college campuses. Trump's EO is merely an extension of longstanding bipartisan policy that suggests that Jews ought to be protected on college campuses by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 'Even if the EO had labeled Jews a 'nationality,  that would have been perfectly in line with Jewish law and tradition. Jews are not merely a religious group. They are in fact a group with shared ancestry, a shared culture, and a shared history. You can join the group by converting, but while religious and philosophic Judaism is a key component of Jewish identity---and the most key component when it comes to standing to speak on Jewish issues, generally---Jewishness isn't just religion.\nThis is one of those journalistic errors that would not have been made if not for the left-leaning media's pre-existing hostility to Trump. If the Times had been told a similar story about an EO to be issued by President Obama (and this appears to be based on Obama-era policy) the paper would have carefully checked the 'nationality' claim before printing it. But because Trump is presumed to have bad intent at all times, they ran with an explosive claim that wasn't true. Great work, guys! I wonder why so many Americans don't trust the media?\nTrump's EO 'Combating Anti-Semitism' arrives as antisemitism continues to proliferate on college campuses, largely under the guise of 'anti-Zionism.  Just a few weeks ago, a former Israeli soldier arrived at Vassar to deliver a speech and was met by raucous protesters from the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. The crowd enthusiastically chanted, 'from the river to the sea,  a popular anti-Zionist refrain that advocates for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the nation of Israel. In 2014, members of NYU's SJP chapter sent out fake eviction notices to Jewish students at NYU in order to 'protest Israeli policies.  Just last year, they crashed an Israeli Independence Day event, stole the flags, and burned them.\nSome note that 'Civil liberties groups have raised alarms that the executive order could suppress constitutionally protected speech. They're right to be concerned. Vile, hateful, and racist words are constitutionally-protected forms of expression. As the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education states, 'The definition of anti-Semitism and examples reach core political speech protected by the First Amendment'. . . 'The order would be far better if it did not refer to a list of anti-Semitic ideaseven if the ideas in that list are vile. Title VI is aimed at conduct, not speech. The bottom line is relatively simplesince Jews are being targeted on the basis of their 'shared ancestry,  they should receive protection under Title VI, but extending that protection does not repeal a single syllable of the First Amendment. Title VI can and should exist in harmony with free speech, and the administration should revise its draft order to remove the possibility that universities will use it to impose new speech codes on students and faculty.\nOthers posit that 'The latest executive order is a welcome way of addressing well-founded concerns about anti-Semitism and discrimination on campus. As with other executive orders, it's possible that the government will interpret and enforce it in a over-bearing way. However, there is no reason to assume that it will. It's worth noting in this regard that Trump has already signed an executive order protecting free speech on campus."

        "document": "President Trump has regularly and repeatedly suggested that America is not the country of American Jews. Israel is 'your country,  he says, and Netanyahu is 'your prime minister'. . . Just a few days ago, Trump proffered a cavalcade of anti-Semitic stereotypes in a speech before the Israeli American Council, lambasting American Jews for their insufficient love of both him and Israel, calling Jews 'not nice people' who would nonetheless be compelled to vote Republican in order to protect their wealth. 'That the same administration that has cried about 'free speech on campus' when it comes to protecting the rights of racist provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos is suddenly a lot more invested in student safety when it might help suppress pro-Palestinian protests provokes fears that it primarily sees the charge of anti-Semitism as a tool to bludgeon wayward Democrats.\nThe draft text suggests concerns about treating Jews as non-Americans were overblown. But is also is a sign that the Trump administration might be willing to expand ongoing efforts to attack the speech rights of Palestinian campuses on campus, an extension of an illiberal trend in organized pro-Israel advocacy that should trouble all of us. 'The Trump Department of Education has already launched several investigations into pro-Palestinian campus speech under the auspices of Title VI. It's possible this could escalate after the executive order. 'In the last year alone, the Department of Education has launched investigations into alleged anti-Semitism at Rutgers University, Duke University, the University of North Carolina, and Williams College. If found to have enabled anti-Semitism on campus, these universities could forfeit millions of dollars in federal funding. Yet, in each case, the 'anti-Semitic' speech being investigated is criticism of Israel. \nMr. Trump's executive order points agencies to the definition of anti-Semitism prepared by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. This definition includes several examples of speech that should be covered by the First Amendment, like 'claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.  For this reason Kenneth Stern, the lead author of the definition, wrote in The Times that it shouldn't be applied to higher education. The agency's definition was prepared for data collectors writing reports in Europe, not for government officials policing campus speech.\nSome, however, note that 'The order only directs agencies to consider the IHRA's list 'to the extent that any examples might be useful as evidence of discriminatory intent.  In other words, applying double standards to Israel alone would not trigger a Title VI investigation. Instead, the IHRA's list would only come into play after an individual is accused of overt anti-Semitism with an ethnic component, and then only as evidence of bigoted intent. 'In fact, it's unclear whether Wednesday's order will have any impact, given that it mostly just reaffirms the current law. It restates the federal government's long-standing interpretation of Title VI to encompass some anti-Jewish bias. And it raises the faint possibility that, in some case down the road, a student's sharp criticism of Israel may be used as evidence of anti-Semitic intent after he has been accused of targeting Jews because of their perceived race or nationality. Is this order red meat for Republicans who believe colleges are increasingly hostile to Jews? Probably. Will it quash the pro-Palestine movement on campuses or impose an unwanted classification on American Jews? Absolutely not."

At one point, nearing the climax, 'Barbie' stops cold so a Mattel doll designer (America Ferrera) with depressive inclinations can deliver a long monologue on how miserable it is to be female. For instance, she feels pressured to have lots of money but also pressured to not appear to seek it.\nTry to imagine 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' as written by someone who not only hated Mario and Luigi but blamed them for highway fatalities, climate change and gorilla abuse while tossing in some Proust references. Don't we go to a movie like 'Barbie' to escape the harrumphing tone of the most aggrieved Twitter users?\nFrom its opening moments, Barbie is intent on telling viewers that it is about feminism, and it takes itself seriously (but not too seriously). We're told, repeatedly over the course of two hours, that being a woman is hard. But beyond a final grasp at choice feminism---women should be whatever they want to be, whether that means a mother or an astronaut or both! ---viewers are not offered much of a path forward. As for any idea of what's good about being a woman, forget about it.\nBarbie echoes a shallow view of womanhood often perpetuated by transgender ideologues, who fetishize the trials of femaleness (periods, catcalls, sexism in general) while imagining the beauty of womanhood as no more than a doll's costume to put on or off. In Barbie's view, being a woman is tough, fraught with double standards (something we're sure men never have to face), and there's really not much good we can say about it. But at least there's a lot of pink.\nSome argue, 'Barbie is an undisciplined, goofy film for women (primarily) to gather for in posses, dress up, and revel in spectacle and recollection. It's two hours of beautiful people wearing gorgeous outfits that observers can recall owning and playing with on linoleum or shag carpeting. Like Saturday-morning cartoons, the movie is a pallet of marketing that just so happens to be good, and, as such, it is palatable consumerism in motion.\nThe politics of the movie are similarly inhuman and absurd---this is the rendering of a world supposed by children, with all the logical errancy that kids produce when all they know of life is from patching together mental woodcuts from whatever Mom and Dad divulge. That Barbie's Ken thinks men run the world by telling everyone what to do is correct---it is precisely what a little girl would imagine employment must be like after observing her mom coming home and routinely grousing about her jerk boss Kent. Grab some lifelong friends and delight in a juggernaut of capitalism. not everything has to be a battleground."

There are perfect jokes about everything from stilettos to boy bands to fascism and Matchbox Twenty; I'm still giggling at some of the gags.\nGerwig's solo directing career thus far (which includes Lady Bird and Little Women) is a triumph of reimagination, an exploration of what it means to find out who you are and not allow yourself to be shaped by nostalgia and sentimentality while also living with deep, real love. That she managed to infuse the same sensibilities into Barbie is something near a miracle.\n'If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you,  promises (or threatens) the trailer. Are audiences meant to cheer on the empowered girlboss exploits of the live-action embodiment of a now 64-year-old fashion doll? Or, on the contrary, should we be critiquing the male gazedriven industrial economy that made generations of little girls believe that the highest achievement of adult womanhood was an anatomically impossible waist-hip ratio? And what about those of us who grew up Barbie-indifferent? .\nYes, yes, and yes, responds Barbie: This movie is for you. Can any one movie be all those things at once? Gerwig's answer to that conundrum is to serve up a multilayered concoction that's as busy as a fully accessorized Dreamhouse: an earnest feminist manifesto inside a barbed social satire inside an effervescent musical comedy, all designed in colors and textures so sumptuous they make 1950s Technicolor look desaturated. Barbie never completely resolves the paradox at its heart. But it is a delight of improbable proportions.\nThe reactionary weirdoes decrying Barbie as peddling the 'woke' agenda haven't pulled much of a gotcha, accurately summarizing the textual substance of a film about one woman's sudden burst of institutional consciousness. Like a college freshman taking an intro class on gender---or perhaps like a high-schooler seeing a mass-market blockbuster with a developed political streak for the first time---Barbie becomes abruptly aware of the untenable societal pressures heaped upon womankind, released in a cathartic monologue by normal-person surrogate America Ferrera.\nShe resolves the many contradictions of the male gaze by slicing through the Gordian knot, simply concluding that whatever women want is fine, so long as everyone lets them live their lives in peace. It's a pretty anodyne statement. The steadfast refusal to coddle male ego may be the most unabashedly subversive notion in a project often conflicted about its opposing mandates as a critical work of art and a commercial good for sale."

There are his tweets, many of which are weird enough to generate the right amount of viral confusion or are pugnacious enough toward Donald Trump to provoke the ire of the presidential Twitter feed. Then there are the influencers. Starting this week the Bloomberg campaign enlisted the help of a number of popular meme-makers to create sponsored Instagram content for the candidate. 'On Twitter, where some Democratic hopefuls have adopted a 'they go low, we go high' mentality, Bloombergians have instead opted to wade into the mud and wrestle with Mr. Trump's Twitter feed. For citizens looking for a movement or big, structural change or even just a genuine vision for the future of the country, the strategy is disheartening---just another brazen attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator instincts of the internet that leaves a sinking feeling that shameless memes, Twitter dunks and toxic screaming into the algorithmic void have become politics as usual. Or maybe it's always been this way. After all, what is politics if not a long, well-funded attempt at hacking people's attention?\nWhat's interesting here is that, even if Bloomberg doesn't win the nomination---which he very likely will not---this digital ad spending could end up mattering, anyway. That's because Bloomberg has pledged to spend a large fortune to dislodge Trump even if he's not the Democratic nominee. 'That a democratic socialist could end up as the nominee, even as Democrats end up relying in part on billionaire Bloomberg's money to fend off what may be the largest disinformation warfare campaign in U. S. history---one partly enabled by the threat the Big Tech oligarchy poses to democracy---is another measure of just how weirdly unsettled our politics are right now. It also hints at the odd compromises that might be necessary to survive the current crisis.\nThrow them up against the wall. It is impossible for me to imagine that those words would have rolled off Bloomberg's tongue had he been speaking to a room full of young black and brown men. Or, if people who looked like members of his own family faced that kind of scrutiny as they moved about their communities. In order for people to unfold their arms, he is going to have to face the wall of justified anger and absorb it at full blast. He has to be willing to talk about race and racism, not once or twice but with consistency and courage. 'He has to be willing to address the mind-set that created stop-and-frisk and keeps some version of it alive. And that means bringing cops to the table and pushing the leadership and the rank-and-file in blue to interrogate the social and racial factors that lead to disproportionate levels of scrutiny aimed at black and brown men. That will not be easy. But it is worth the risk. A leader who can create a pathway toward a model of policing that seeks justice, while facing up to historical injustice, would be doing a great thing for all of America.\n'Ninety-five percent of murders, murderers and murder victims' are male minorities between 16 to 25, Bloomberg said in 2015. This is actually not true -- not in New York City, and not nationwide. Lots of Democrats made significant mistakes in the 1990s when it came to being tough on crime -- mistakes that were readily apparent by the mid-2000s. But You cannot be the leader of a diverse, justice-oriented party when you said, just a few years ago -- well after we well knew just how damaging over-policing and mass incarceration are -- that 'the way you get the guns out of the kid's hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them. \nSome, however, argue that 'Bloomberg's mistakes. have to be weighed against a record of courageously speaking out and devoting enormous personal resources to virtually every progressive cause---gun control, abortion rights, climate change, Planned Parenthood, education reform for predominantly minority schools, affordable housing, income inequality and tax reform. And he has vowed as president to focus on building black wealth, not just ending poverty. Sitting here today, Bloomberg---paired with a progressive vice-presidential candidate who can appeal to Sanders's voters---has the best chance to carry the day."

        "document": "In an ominous report Wednesday, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg came in first in a poll in Arkansas. No one has yet assessed the sheer amount of money he is spending. He may spend more on Facebook than Klobuchar will spend on her entire campaign. 'But Bloomberg's problem was made vivid this week as his past comments about stop and frisk policing in Black neighborhoods received widespread condemnation. The massive, well-executed Bloomberg ad campaign may crash and burn on the reality of the true Bloomberg. As an old adage goes, the ads failed because they worked. A good ad campaign kills a bad product fast---because it gets more people to try it. Bloomberg may have a clever 'buy the White House' idea. But it may be that the country gets vaccinated by Bloomberg himself, and the billions he spends in the end can't move people once their minds are made up.\nMost critics argue the recording from 2015 will make it difficult for him to attract far-left liberals and black voters, and some think it could be fatal to his chances. I don't think that's true. He was a successful mayor without seriously compromising his blunt style, and New Yorkers generally liked that about him, even when they disagreed. 'Assuming the issue recedes, I think he has a good chance of landing the most important endorsement of all---Barack Obama's. The two have been allies, if not friends, and Obama did not endorse Bloomberg's black Democratic opponent in 2009, Bill Thompson, instead using an appearance with Bloomberg to call him an 'outstanding mayor'. Obama has let it be known that he does not want Bernie Sanders to get the party's nomination. If Bloomberg can manage to make himself Sanders' top opponent, it's easy to imagine Obama leading the establishment in backing him, which would go a long way toward securing the nomination.\nSome posit that 'There's a lot that can and should be said about Bloomberg's comments. First, the stop-and-frisk policy Bloomberg was advocating for was of questionable necessity. When New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio did away with the policy a few years ago, many conservatives expressed concern that de Blasio was effectively handicapping the city's law enforcement. But. . . crime in the city continued to decrease significantly---even without stop and frisk. 'And it should go without saying that Bloomberg is engaging in deliberate racial profiling and that this is wrong and shameful. This mindset should give any reasonable person pause, and it should call into question Bloomberg's ability to lead a diverse country that is already divided. With that said, the timing of when this audio was released reveals something about the Democratic Party and the war for the black vote among its presidential candidates.\nOthers argue that 'There are some legitimate civil liberties concerns about 'stop-and-frisk', although living in a city the size of New York comes with some loss of personal freedoms. But the application of 'stop-and-frisk' was not motivated by race, it was motivated by policing where the crime is. It's was what Thomas Sowell called disparity rather than discrimination. There are electoral reasons conservatives might want to help paint Bloomberg as racist, even if they don't really believe it. This trolly approach with its healthy dose of schadenfreude is understandable, but it's also wrong. The larger opportunity here is to use this incident to expose how irrational leftist definitions of racism are.\nIt is too bad that Bloomberg has to tar the Stop and Frisk program with such over the top generalizations of who commits murder. What Bloomberg also misses out on is that while there are good reasons to disarm criminals, poor minorities, the very people who are most likely victims of violent crime, are the ones who benefit the most from carrying concealed handguns. Bloomberg's claim doesn't distinguish between law-abiding blacks who want to protect themselves and the criminals. 'President Trump's moves on criminal justice reform, coupled with historically low minority unemployment rates, are already threatening to make inroads on minority voting. A Bloomberg nomination might make these inroads even greater and set the stage for a resounding electoral victory by Trump."

        "stance": "left",
        "document": "According to experts, in roughly two months, Israel caused more destruction in Gaza than the battle for Aleppo in Syria or the razing of Mariupol in Ukraine, and killed more civilians than the United States and its allies did in a three-year campaign against the Islamic State. Proportionally, Israel's campaign has exceeded the destruction of the Allied bombings of Germany in World War II.\nU. S. intelligence estimated that 40 to 45 percent of the 29, 000 bombs Israel had dropped were unguided, prone to cause greater collateral damage. Indeed, an Israeli rear admiral acknowledged before the ground invasion began that while the Israel Defense Forces was 'balancing accuracy. right now, we're focused on what causes maximum damage. . Israel will one day have to ask itself whether it acted appropriately in the heat of its anger and sorrow after Oct. 7.\nThe words of Israeli officials are being offered as evidence of intent: from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging Israelis to 'remember' the Old Testament account of the carnage of Amalek ('Spare no one, but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings,  reads one passage) to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowing that 'Gaza won't return to what it was before---we will eliminate everything' to the minister of energy and infrastructure pledging, 'They will not receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave this world. .\nI have heard many people balk at the suggestion that Gaza could be experiencing genocide. The Holocaust, after all, wiped out over 60 percent of European Jews. Israel's war---instigated, no less, by the murder of Jews---has killed about 1 percent of the Palestinians in Gaza. One percent is terrible, of course, but genocide? Under the genocide convention, though, the term describes an intent to wipe out a defined group of people and taking steps to achieve that end. There is no threshold of death or proportion of death that must be reached.\nOthers argue, 'there is no evidence that Israeli forces have engaged in a deliberate campaign to 'destroy, in whole or in part,  the Palestinian people---which is what 'genocide' means in international law. Awful as the civilian deaths in Gaza have been, they still constitute less than 1 percent of the territory's population. If Israel, with all the firepower at its disposal, had been trying to commit mass murder, the death toll would have been higher by orders of magnitude.\nBut, however the case turns out, one thing is certain: It will do nothing to relieve the suffering of Palestinians. These incendiary accusations only serve, for many Israelis, to discredit more legitimate, more measured criticism of Israel's actions. They play into Netanyahu's 'us vs. the world' narrative in which the right-wing prime minister is the only person who can protect Israelis. Many of whom, no doubt, will wrongly conclude that self-restraint on the part of their forces is pointless if they are going to be accused of genocide no matter what they do."

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "Genocide is a crime that requires specific actions and intent- i. e. acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such. By all accounts, including South Africa's, Israel has the undeniable military capability to completely destroy the entire Gaza Strip in a matter of minutes if it so desired. Noticeably, Israel has not done so, and instead has taken extreme measures to protect Gazan civilians.\nThe entire context of Israel's military response is completely, indefensibly, ignored; nowhere does the application even consider the possibility that Israel's actions are lawful under the doctrines of, say, military necessity, proportionality, force protection, or deterrence in responding to a terrorist organization. Yes, blockades and sieges could be war crimes---but they aren't in this case; both the Geneva and Hague Conventions include instructions on conducting sieges under international law, and Israel has followed those rules to the letter.\nIn recent decades, as many as three million people perished in a famine in North Korea that was mainly government-induced. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians were gassed, bombed, starved or tortured to death by the Assad regime, and an estimated 14 million were forced to flee their homes. China has put more than a million Uyghurs through gulag-like re-education camps.\nBut North Korea, Syria and China have never been charged with genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel has. The war between Israel and Hamas is terrible---as is every war. But if this is genocide, what word do we have for the killing fields in Cambodia, Stalin's Holodomor in Ukraine, the Holocaust itself? .\nIf Israel were trying to commit genocide, it wouldn't be putting its soldiers at risk or allowing humanitarian relief to arrive from Egypt or withdrawing many of its forces from Gaza. It would simply be killing Palestinians everywhere, in vastly greater numbers, as Germans killed Jews or Hutus killed Tutsis.\nBut arguing the merits presumes this case is more than political theater. South Africa sees U. N. grandstanding as a way to curry favor with Russia, China and Iran, which are eager to reduce Western influence. Where was South Africa's moral outrage when the country tolerated Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe, or when it opposed the indictment of Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir for killing some 200, 000 people in Darfur? .\nIf the U. N. wants to find genocidal intent, try the Hamas charter. The preamble says 'Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.  It encourages Muslims to 'fight Jews and kill them' until the Jews 'hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.  The moral inversion of the U. N. continues."
