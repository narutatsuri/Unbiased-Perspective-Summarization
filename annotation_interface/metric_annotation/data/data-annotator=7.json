        "stance": "left",
        "document": "The talking point President Donald Trump and top administration officials are using to explain the abrupt dismissal of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire---namely, that his dismissal was required by law---doesn't add up. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien claimed Maguire had to go because he couldn't serve as acting director of national intelligence past March 11 due to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. But Maguire could've stayed on as acting director of national intelligence indefinitely had Trump nominated someone to become Senate-confirmed before March 11. 'Also, if the Trump administration is really concerned about the March 11 cutoff, then appointing Grenell to the acting role won't address it, as he now faces the same deadline that Maguire did before his dismissal. Maguire's ouster may be part of Trump's broader effort to get rid of government officials he perceives as being insufficiently loyal.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Trump was angry at Maguire because he was afraid Democrats would use the information about Russian interference against him. And I suppose he's right. Another alternative, of course, would be for Trump to do something about Russian interference, which would neuter any possible Democratic complaints. Apparently, though, that's out of the question. Don't you know there's an election coming up? 'Kevin Drum, Mother Jones\n\nRussian election meddling is not the only area where Trump doesn't want to hear the conclusions of his top spies. For weeks now, officials in the country's intelligence agencies, and in oversight committees on Capitol Hill, have been trying to determine the fate of the intelligence community's annual Worldwide Threat Assessment. as it has in past years, it contains the conclusion that Russia, not Ukraine, meddled in the 2016 U. S. elections in an effort to help Trump, and is doing so again this year. But as past ones have, this year's assessment also contains other conclusions that are at odds with the president. 'Officials familiar with the document say it contradicts Trump's stated positions on: the likelihood of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons program; the prospects that a 'maximum pressure' campaign will force Iran to abandon its nuclear efforts; whether ISIS remains a threat; and climate change as a threat to national security. The effort to block the release of the threat assessment cuts against more than a decade of increased transparency during which the report has been made public in redacted form.\n\nRegarding Grenell, 'he has little intelligence experience and has never run a large bureaucracy. Before he was dispatched to Berlin, he worked as a public affairs consultant and commentator for Fox News. Before that, he was a communications official in President George W. Bush's administration. He has been an aggressive public cheerleader for Mr. Trump, fiercely and frequently defending him on Fox News and on social media. That appears to be the qualification that truly matters to this president---especially when it comes to overseeing an intelligence community that Mr. Trump has always believed has been out to get him. 'Presidents have tended to shy away from politicizing national intelligence---or at least tried to avoid the perception of such politicization. But Mr. Trump has made clear that he will not tolerate any discussion of Russia's meddling in American politics, no matter how compelling the evidence. He is sending a very public message: In this White House, protecting Donald Trump's interests is what matters.\n\nThe DNI must be seen as a neutral arbiter among America's vast intelligence community that ranges from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) to the FBI, DEA and intelligence units of the Departments of State, Energy, Homeland Security and Treasury. He or she must be a mediator, bringing often-conflicting people and ideas together to reach a consensus or at least a viable menu of choices for the president's final decision on life-or-death matters. But above all, this individual must be deeply conversant with the arcane language and practices, sources and methods that make up the core mission of the intelligence communities. Rick Grenell brings none of this to the table.\n\nOur allies won't trust us if our own officers face constant pressure to politicize intelligence. That means reporting streams will dry up, we won't get early warning on planned attacks and we will lose critical knowledge about the decisions adversaries are making that may not have consequences today, but could have huge ones in the next decade. It's impossible to know how many clues we will miss if our intelligence community is isolated from the world and the president's daily brief only reinforces what the administration wants to hear. I hope Mr. Grenell makes a careful assessment of the intelligence community's capacities and impressive work force before making further changes. How dangerous it would be if we lose the tip of the spear against those who would destroy us."

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. 'A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn't changed since late April. More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.\n\nAlthough the true number of unemployed people is a matter of debate, the data show that as many as 27. 5 percent of Americans lost their job or had their hours scaled back as a result of the shutdowns. That's more than 30 million Americans, at a minimum, who were hit hard economically. We simply cannot sustain that level of economic catastrophe much longer. 'Rises in the coronavirus infection and hospitalization rates have to be put into context. We must minimize the potential loss of life, but public health measures must also be weighed against the cost of millions of ruined lives. Keeping the economy closed and the lockdowns tight would be fatal to America itself. To do this would be the public health equivalent of the famous quote from a dispatch during the Vietnam War: 'It was necessary to destroy the village in order to save it. \n\nMaximum lockdowns were never a realistic long-term option. The end of our patience was never going to coincide with the end of the pandemic. Yes, warmer weather will probably help some, along with more Americans spending more time outdoors. In some parts of the country, lots of people are still wearing masks; in other parts of the country, not so much. Ending idiotic policies about returning still-contagious patients to nursing homes will help reduce the death rate considerably. 'But. the virus is still out there. The fact that people would rather play out an American version of China's Cultural Revolution, complete with public 'struggle sessions,  or go over footage of a cop shoving a senior citizen in Buffalo like it's the Zapruder film, or remove the television show Cops from the airwaves---because having camera crews ride along with police officers is somehow enabling police brutality---does not change any facts about the virus and its spread.\n\nThe coronavirus has not disappeared, and the rules governing our response to it are still being applied to businesses, schools, churches, and other organizations. In Maryland, for example, outdoor religious services have been banned completely by Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich. And my church in northern Virginia has decided to hold off on in-person services, outdoors or indoors, because the regulations are too vague and too difficult to navigate. Where were these regulations during Saturday's protest? . 'Government officials cannot selectively restrict constitutional rights. Either the law applies to everyone, or it doesn't apply at all. In other words, if protesters have the right to gather, churches should have that right as well. Any other application of the law is hypocritical and unconstitutional.\n\nWith coronavirus, government has been aggressive to excessive. When business owners have attempted to reopen ahead of government timelines, many have faced harsh responses. Government actions and reactions have been aimed at normal activities by otherwise law-abiding citizens. Meanwhile, government has been permissive to passive (at least initially) with protests. Here, government action has not been taken against people gathering en masse in violation of health orders, even when some of those protests turned to violent riots. 'The danger Democrats increasingly face is that Middle America and moderate voters will see these increasingly stark juxtapositions. Democrats need protests to end now---yesterday actually. The longer they last, the worse Democrats look, and the greater the likelihood that Middle America and moderate voters make a connection from current chaos, to coronavirus, to leftward campaign content---and break with Democrats."

        "document": "I would not say that any of the candidates had a breakout moment or a great zinger, but none of them suffered a huge mistake either. I don't expect that anyone will move up or down in the polls very much based on their performance tonight. Sanders took more hits than he did last time, but not as many as I thought he would. Warren still pulled her punches, saying only that she could get things done better than Bernie. Klobuchar said pretty much the same thing. Bloomberg hit Bernie hard early on, but I'm not sure anyone noticed.\n\nCompared to her treatment of Bloomberg Warren treaded much more lightly with Sanders, although she did draw more of a contrast with him than she has in the past. 'Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie,  she said, explaining that she's had more success in the fights she's waged, such as pushing for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She said their plans for Medicare for All were similar, but his 'doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.  'I dug in,  Warren continued. 'I did the work, and then Bernie's team trashed me for it. We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done.  It was a clear shot, but like so many of the attacks leveled against Sanders tonight, it was a glancing blow. For Warren, as for the others, it might have come too late.\n\nBy far Sanders's most vulnerable moment came when Norah O'Donnell brought up Sanders's kind words for Cuban literacy programs. Like many leftists, Sanders expressed heavily caveated solidarity for leftist regimes like Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s, especially when those regimes were being threatened by right-wing authoritarian movements backed by the US. 'Sanders gave a satisfactory explanation of his comments on Cuba, situating them in the context of former President Barack Obama's historic opening to the country. 'Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba. I said what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education,  Sanders said. 'Occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran.  'Being honest' about topics that politicians aren't typically honest about is at the core of Sanders's appeal as a candidate, and he showed he could take the same approach when asked about Cuba. It was a good audition for the general, and crucially for a frontrunner, he did no harm to his standing in the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Mayor Pete made a solid, regular case for just about every solid, regular subject. If this were a contest in sounding reasonable, then Buttigieg would run away with the contest. But the metronomic mayor regulates his beat a little too precisely to have a true pulse. Yes, he admitted, there was a progressive majority. 'But, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.  It takes a peculiar love of reason to think you can campaign against passion by pushing for lower blood pressure. Don't get too excited now.\n\nSome argue that 'The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor was at his absolute best in this debate. He found several occasions to make direct contrasts with Bernie Sanders -- most notably on the dangers for Democrats of nominating a democratic socialist and the differences in their health care plans -- which is a win in and of itself. Buttigieg also flashed a sense of humor when plugging his website to encourage donations, which was a welcome moment of levity in a debate defined by people shouting at one another at very close range. If voters were looking for a Sanders alternative who looked like he could be commander in chief in this debate, Buttigieg made a very good case for himself.\n\nFinally, 'By the metrics of shoring up his base, Biden did well. He was forceful and on message. He won much applause for his promise to appoint an African American woman to the Supreme Court. He kept alluding to his record as Obama's vice president and his experience on the world stage. Biden made the case for himself as a tough, experienced, and trustworthy leader."

Pelosi had to bring along a caucus that wanted more comprehensive legislation that would cover all uninsured Americans rather than just many of them. She persuaded House Democrats to accept the best possible bill that the Senate would also pass.\n\nShe got the House to pass the $787 billion 2008 stimulus bill; the Dodd-Frank legislation reforming Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis; the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act attacking pay discrimination against women; and the repeal of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. Last year, under President Biden---and working with the slimmest of majorities---Pelosi shepherded through the House a $1. 9 trillion covid-19 relief package, a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that had been talked about for more than a decade; and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nMichigan Rep. Dan Kildee, a member of Democrats' whip team, told reporters Tuesday a story from when Pelosi was minority leader and Paul Ryan was speaker. It was during the water crisis in Flint, which Kildee represents. 'I still remember her calling me into her office from the floor, and getting on the phone with Paul Ryan, who was the speaker, and working it out for me to negotiate directly with Paul on Flint recovery,  Kildee said.\n\nShe told Ryan she could deliver the Democratic votes he needed to pass a spending bill in return for him funding one of their priorities, and sent Kildee to Ryan's office. 'And so, over the course of a couple hours,  he said, 'we worked out the Flint water crisis support, which was not widely supported by Republicans at the time.  God knows how many stories there are like this from Pelosi's tenure.\n\nWhen John Boehner took over as speaker in 2011, he'd already been the No. 2 person in the Republican leadership. When he stepped aside in 2015 he was replaced by Paul Ryan, the main architect of Boehner-era GOP policy priorities and a former vice presidential candidate. When Ryan, in turn, stepped down in 2019, he was replaced as GOP leader by Kevin McCarthy, who'd been the No. 2 guy under both Ryan and Boehner.\n\nBy contrast Representative Hakeem Jeffries, though seen for years as the heir apparent, is the fourth-ranking House Democrat---not No. 2---and has never chaired a committee. House Democrats ought to put in place structural reforms to ensure that more members Jeffries' age will have the ability to take on more substantive responsibility before reaching the top ranks of leadership."

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "President Trump once vowed to drain the swamp, but by joining with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the latest budget deal, he has merely drained it of the Tea Party. There are many ways in which the Trump presidency has been disruptive to the status quo. But when it comes to spending and deficits, he has restored Washington to a much more conventional place in which both parties agree to ignore warnings of fiscal disaster, and resolve their differences by simply agreeing to spend more money. 'Trump's Republican Party may want to dismiss the importance of the debt, but the numbers don't lie. The nation's federal debt will surpass unprecedented levels in the coming decades, and neither party even wants to pretend to care about it.\n\nThe tea party burst into Washington pledging spending restraint, balanced budgets, and accountable government. Even the possibility of defaulting on the national debt was an acceptable price of reform. Roughly a decade later, budget deficits are again reaching $1 trillion, spending is soaring, Obamacare remains on the books, and Republicans are raising the debt limit and eviscerating their lead accomplishment, the Budget Control Act. With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?\n\nThis 'is exactly how Washington has worked for decades. This is a place where politicians splurge today, and promise to repent tomorrow. And where 'compromising' means adding your differences together, rather than splitting them. To understand what this means for the deficit, consider that if Congress had simply held spending growth to the rate of inflation after 2014, the deficit this year would be $400 billion, instead of more than $1 trillion. 'It's important to note that this problem is not being driven by Trump's tax cuts. Even with those cuts in place, federal revenues are near the postwar average, and they are slated to continue to claim a larger share of GDP each year for the next several decades. The problem is entirely on the spending side. The CBO's forecast has spending closing in on 30% of GDP by 2049---and that's assuming there aren't any major new entitlement programs. 'Editorial Board, Issues & Insights\n\nThe good newsthe only good newsis that the deal continues the Trump Administration's modest defense buildup. Several years in a row of predictable, higher funding will allow the Pentagon to improve the readiness of fighter squadrons, build a few more ships, improve missile defenses and invest in technologyall necessary for maintaining the military's competitive edge. The price Democrats extorted for essential national security is another two-year blowout in domestic accounts. 'Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are crowing that they 'secured an increase of more than $100 billion in funding for domestic priorities since President Trump took office.  This is all the more remarkable because Democrats have only had a majority in the House, and only for seven months. Everybody's happy except the future taxpayers who will pay for it.\n\nNevertheless, 'in these highly polarized times, just reaching this kind of agreement is an achievement in itself, no matter how unimaginative or bad it might be. Give Trump credit, seriously, for nailing down an agreement with the caucus that's currently battling over whether to impeach him. That credit gets split with Pelosi, who is trying mightily to quell impeachment talk so that Democrats can present some set of positive accomplishments on which to propose keeping their House majority in 2020.\n\nSome contend that 'we have big government because the voters want it that way. it is time for conservatives to understand there is no political will to significantly cut spending in the absence of an overall bipartisan deal. Rank-and-file Republicans may want lower spending, but they clearly prioritize other issues such as immigration, trade, tax cuts and religious liberty. It is also clear that moderates, both the Obama-Trump blue-collar types and the suburban Romney-Clinton voters, prefer much more spending than does the GOP's right. 'The Republican Party needs to show it understands what voters want by proposing a serious deficit-reduction package that includes tax increases on those who can afford it, in addition to a package of spending cuts. a new bipartisan compromise could achieve what a decade of futile gesturing has not: reduced deficits and moderate growth in government spending."

        "topic": "Impeachment Hearings Continue",
        "stance": "left",
        "document": "'Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.  Those are the damning words of President Trump's handpicked ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who on Wednesday morning directly implicated not only Mr. Trump, but also several top members of his administration. 'Mr. Trump claims that he did nothing wrong, yet the White House refuses to let most of these people appear under oath. (Mr. Sondland himself defied orders not to testify from the White House and the State Department. ) It's worth emphasizing this point: All the witnesses whose testimony has been damaging to Mr. Trump have given that testimony under oath. All of those who we are led to believe would exonerate the president have so far refused to testify. If Mr. Trump truly believes he insisted on no conditions for the White House meeting and the aid for Ukraine, he has a clear choice: Let people testify. At this point it's hard to see what reason they have for continuing to refuse.\n\nThe president's defenders have leaned into a version of Nunes's argument that Trump was just very interested in rooting out Ukrainian corruption. According to this line of argument, Trump's interest onlycoincidentally happened to dovetail with an investigation of his possible chief political rival in the 2020 election and in a conspiracy theory that might damage the results of the Mueller investigation. Sondland's testimony, though, demonstrates that even if you wanted to accept this absurd premise, the evidence and testimony don't show Trump seeking any sort of genuine investigation. Instead, according to Sondland, he strictly wanted the announcement of one. 'As others in the impeachment inquiry have previously testified, if Trump actually wanted an investigation of corruption by American citizens, then the Department of Justice was the appropriate place for that to start. If the DOJ needed help from the Ukrainians to conduct such a legitimate investigation, they could request that help through what's called a mutual legal assistance treaty. None of that ever happened. Instead, there were secret back-channels and deals and demands. As we continue to learn, a legitimate investigation was never what Trump wanted. What he wanted was help in his reelection campaign, and he was willing to leverage America's national security to get it.\n\nZelensky 'had to announce the investigations,  Sondland said, referring to the probes into Biden's family and the 2016 election. 'He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it.  Legal experts previously told CNN that this is a critical distinction. Most legitimate investigations are done in secret, so as not to tip off the supposed criminals. But the intense focus on securing a public announcement from Zelensky demonstrates that the scheme was really designed to maximize the political benefit to Trump, instead of a good-faith effort to investigate corruption.\n\nThe GOP defense is now this: Trump is exonerated, because it hasn't yet been nailed down beyond any doubt that Trumpdirectly commanded Sondland to tell Ukraine that the money was withheld for that corrupt purpose. Sondland unequivocally confirmed that Trump was using the White House meeting as leverage to get the investigations he wanted, and that numerous top officials were in on that corrupt scheme. Now that it has been established that Trump dangled a meeting to force an investigation of Biden, how likely is it that Trump suddenly didn'tintend to use the frozen military aid for that same purpose, at precisely the moment he was bothobsessing over that goal and was maximizing his leverage over Ukraine to its highest point yet?\n\nThe hearings have demonstrated in detail the extent to which Trump conflates his personal grudges with America's interests, even when the former harms the latter, and how he allows those private grudges to dictate foreign policy decisions that impact multiple countries. A foreign policy driven by a person unwilling to govern his feelings, subordinate his grudges, or follow rules is not a policy at all. It's a puff of air, a set of whims. It's a vague hunch his yay-sayers must interpret and try to execute, and apologize for when he changes his mind and blames them for getting it wrong.\n\nThere are many pundits who will opine that removing a president is divisive and unprecedented. It is true that no president has ever been removed from office through the impeachment process. But that just speaks to how rare it has been for a president to even get to the point we are at now. And while it is certainly true that there are people who would be upset by his removal from office, the far greater risk lies in allowing this president, with this explicitly illegal, immoral and unjust track record of abusing the power of his office for his personal electoral benefit, to participate in future elections. Doing so would deprive the people of their constitutional right to choose their leader in a free, open and fair election."

        "document": "New hot spots are emerging in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. Some of that spike is probably the result of more testing. But what's so concerning is that the positive test rate is also increasing at the same time, up from less than 8 percent at the end of May to nearly 14 percent now. It is difficult to ignore that the places seeing surges in Covid-19 cases began to reopen businesses and other public spaces a few weeks ago. 'The nationwide protests over George Floyd's death, police violence, and structural racism have also been met with concerns that they would become superspreading events. According to the experts I spoke with, however, it is simply too early to know whether the coronavirus will spread widely because of the protests. And it is worth remembering the differences between outdoor and indoor exposure, the latter being much more dangerous; it could end up being the case that people got infected because they were arrested and put into a police van or jail cell with other people, not because they were outside protesting in a big crowd.\n\nSome argue that 'I've been a vocal supporter of these protests from their start. But what we should not tolerate, and what the scientific community cannot permit if it is to retain its credibility, is the abuse and manipulation of health expertise for political ends. One of two things is true; either 1) these protests will lead to a significant spike in coronavirus infections and deaths, in which case public health experts should reconcile that outcome with how they could have encouraged and endorsed them; or 2) it will not lead to such a spike, in which case it will appear that the months of extreme, draconian lockdowns---which caused great suffering and deprivation around the world---were excessive, misguided and unwarranted.\n\nOthers note that 'The people who are marching in the streets right now are well aware of the risk of coronavirus transmission. They are not acting out of ignorance that needs to be corrected by public-health experts. As one protester in Minneapolis said, 'Yes, corona is happening. It's real, it's deadly. But racism kills way more lives'. Even if public-health experts did want to stop the protests, they almost certainly could not. Any public-health pronouncements to the hundreds of thousands of people marching around the U. S. and worldwide would be like shouting into a mighty wind. 'Many experts, and some public-health officials, have adopted a harm-reduction approach to the protests, accepting that they must happen and offering recommendations to help people protest as safely as possible. Others have gone further by handing out masks and other protective gear on-site. The decision reflects what public-health experts have always tried to do: maximize the health of the population across all aspects of life.\n\nExperts never said that eternal lockdowns were the only choice we had to combat the pandemic. They argued that once areas got the initial case spikes under control through widespread social distancing (with new cases decreasing over at least a two-week span), a new phase of control should begin with widespread testing and contact tracing. The initial lockdown period avoided the worst possible scenario, but the US didn't use that time to prepare for managing the pandemic in the future. And now we've wasted the weeks that have passed since reopening. 'We managed to disrupt our economy and skyrocket unemployment, and we didn't control the damn virus,  said Jeff Shaman, an infectious disease modeler at Columbia University.\n\nOur current vaccine production infrastructure is already strained and. building new infrastructure is both expensive and complicated. It costs anywhere from $50 to $700 million to build a new facility and takes years to complete. Existing production facilities are highly specialized for making a single, specific type of vaccine, like polio or measles, and they are currently reserved to make those vaccines. If those facilities are repurposed to make a new COVID-19 vaccine, it will put the supply of other critical vaccines at risk. 'In addition, shortages of supplies like syringes and vials could delay the delivery of current vaccines and a future COVID-19 vaccine. Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, warned that there are only 200 million vials left in the world because they've all been bought up. Operation Warp Speed is a fantastic goal. It needs a plan to match it."

If the migrant caravan members not only understand they aren't welcome, but that they will actually be prosecuted under a statute that, if convicted, requires a penalty far more serious than a slap on the wrist, perhaps that Mexican asylum offer wouldn't seem so unreasonable by comparison. \n\nWill trying to stop the caravan work? Maybe, maybe not, but the point is to show an executive acting like an executive in defending the country's borders. Contrast this to the lack of effective action that took place during the 'children's caravans' a few years back in the Obama administration.

Staying in Syria 'until the last remnants of the Islamic State' are defeated commits U. S. forces to remain for a long time to come. When any group like this has been beaten, there are always going to be a few scattered members that survive. Going after those last few 'remnants' isn't a good reason to keep U. S. troops illegally in a country where they were never properly authorized to go.\n\nIt is not just a question of implementing the right policy, but of policy being implemented by the right person. Getting policy right matters, but constitutional and democratic norms must also be preserved. the military is being deployed without the approval of Congress and against the wishes of the American people. The foreign policy establishment has persistently subverted the president's policy of withdrawal from the Syria conflict. Even if their policy is right, none of the goals of American involvement in Syria are worth shredding the Constitution for.\n\nMeanwhile, others argue that 'leaving southern Syria in the hands of Iran is asking for a regional war. if the US leaves a vacuum in southern Syria, Iran will try to fill it---and Israel will unleash waves of attacks to prevent that from happening. That could very well cause an extremely large boom in the region, one which will eventually entangle the US and Russia and maybe even China.\n\nRegarding potential disagreement between Trump and Bolton, 'it is well known in Washington that over the past two weeks, President Trump has been adjusting his plan to withdraw American troops from Syria in response to feedback from experts, members of Congress, and foreign leaders. Bolton's statements about conditions for a withdrawal of U. S. troops from Syria were no different than what President Trump told Senator Graham a week earlier."

Democrats led by Barack Obama went all-in on a government bailout and politically driven bankruptcy settlement for GM in 2009, which cost American taxpayers billions of dollars.

        "document": "Juxtapose the treatment of an actual anti-Semitic attack by two black perpetrators affiliated with a black supremacist group with the media and Twitter Left's treatment of Donald Trump's executive order (EO) targeting anti-Semitism on college campuses. Trump's EO is merely an extension of longstanding bipartisan policy that suggests that Jews ought to be protected on college campuses by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 'Even if the EO had labeled Jews a 'nationality,  that would have been perfectly in line with Jewish law and tradition. Jews are not merely a religious group. They are in fact a group with shared ancestry, a shared culture, and a shared history. You can join the group by converting, but while religious and philosophic Judaism is a key component of Jewish identity---and the most key component when it comes to standing to speak on Jewish issues, generally---Jewishness isn't just religion.\n\nThis is one of those journalistic errors that would not have been made if not for the left-leaning media's pre-existing hostility to Trump. If the Times had been told a similar story about an EO to be issued by President Obama (and this appears to be based on Obama-era policy) the paper would have carefully checked the 'nationality' claim before printing it. But because Trump is presumed to have bad intent at all times, they ran with an explosive claim that wasn't true. Great work, guys! I wonder why so many Americans don't trust the media?\n\nTrump's EO 'Combating Anti-Semitism' arrives as antisemitism continues to proliferate on college campuses, largely under the guise of 'anti-Zionism.  Just a few weeks ago, a former Israeli soldier arrived at Vassar to deliver a speech and was met by raucous protesters from the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. The crowd enthusiastically chanted, 'from the river to the sea,  a popular anti-Zionist refrain that advocates for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the nation of Israel. In 2014, members of NYU's SJP chapter sent out fake eviction notices to Jewish students at NYU in order to 'protest Israeli policies.  Just last year, they crashed an Israeli Independence Day event, stole the flags, and burned them.\n\nSome note that 'Civil liberties groups have raised alarms that the executive order could suppress constitutionally protected speech. They're right to be concerned. Vile, hateful, and racist words are constitutionally-protected forms of expression. As the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education states, 'The definition of anti-Semitism and examples reach core political speech protected by the First Amendment'. 'The order would be far better if it did not refer to a list of anti-Semitic ideaseven if the ideas in that list are vile. Title VI is aimed at conduct, not speech. The bottom line is relatively simplesince Jews are being targeted on the basis of their 'shared ancestry,  they should receive protection under Title VI, but extending that protection does not repeal a single syllable of the First Amendment. Title VI can and should exist in harmony with free speech, and the administration should revise its draft order to remove the possibility that universities will use it to impose new speech codes on students and faculty.\n\nOthers posit that 'The latest executive order is a welcome way of addressing well-founded concerns about anti-Semitism and discrimination on campus. As with other executive orders, it's possible that the government will interpret and enforce it in a over-bearing way. However, there is no reason to assume that it will. It's worth noting in this regard that Trump has already signed an executive order protecting free speech on campus."

Russian soldiers, strengthened by their stunning victory, would already be on the borders of Poland, setting up new command posts, digging new trenches. NATO would be in chaos; the entire alliance would be forced to spend billions to prepare for the inevitable invasion of Warsaw, Vilnius, or Berlin.\n\nOn the other side of the world, Chinese plans to invade Taiwan would be well under way, because Beijing would assume that an America unwilling to defend a European ally, and now totally bogged down in a long-term battle against an emboldened Russia, would never go out of its way to help an island in the Pacific. The Iranian mullahs, equally cheered by Russia's success and Ukraine's defeat, would have boldly announced that they had finally acquired nuclear weapons.\n\nBut none of this happened. Because Zelensky stayed in Kyiv. Zelensky came to Washington to thank Americans on behalf of Ukraine, but in truth, it is we who should be thanking them.\n\nWednesday sent a strong signal of commitment---material and political, Ukrainian and American. As such, the day provided a capstone to a year that began amid fear of a quick and complete Russian conquest but is ending in frustration for Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. Ukraine has lost territory, to be sure; but it has taken some back. The chances that it will emerge from war as a viable state are far greater than the chances Russia will swallow it. Ukraine did not capitulate in a matter of days, as Mr. Putin had planned, and the combat has been costly in blood and treasure for Russia as well as Ukraine.\n\nTo call this unexpected situation a miracle would not do justice to the courage and sacrifice of the Ukrainian people, led by Mr. Zelensky. Nor would it give due credit to the strategic choices the Biden administration and the United States' NATO allies made, none of which was foreordained, all of which were fraught with risk---and most of which have paid off. The U. S. commitment to Ukraine is costly  but much less costly than it would be to live in a world in which Mr. Putin makes the rules.\n\nIn his address to Congress, Zelensky said emphatically that he seeks 'absolute victory' over Russia, the same kind of triumph that President Franklin D. Roosevelt promised as the United States was entering World War II. 'The Ukrainian people will win, too, absolutely,  he said. Zelensky used the word 'victory' 11 times in his speech, and once during his remarks to reporters at the White House after his meeting with President Biden.\n\nTellingly, Biden didn't use the word a single time. Instead, he promised support for Ukraine's 'unbreakable determination. to choose their own path' and pledged: 'We will stay with you for as long as it takes. At some point next year, the tension beneath the surface in this war summit will have to be addressed. There will need to be greater clarity and convergence on what Ukrainian success looks like, short of 'absolute victory.  But for now, let's take Zelensky's formula."

        "stance": "right",
        "document": "The Democratic contenders finally realized that they need to aim their fire at Bernie Sanders, rather than on their fellow trailers. Even Buttigieg and Kloubuchar were able to resist skewering each other. Only Elizabeth Warren seems not to have received the memo. She continued to savage Michael Bloomberg. Why she thinks this will help salvage her failing campaign is beyond me. 'As for the attacks on Sanders, I question whether they will set him back much. For one thing, most of the attacks centered on electability. The argument wasn't so much that Sanders is wrong on policy, but rather that the boldness of his proposals make him unelectable and will bring down Democratic congressional candidates. Sanders deflected this line of attack by citing polls that show him running ahead of President Trump. Moreover, many Democrats admire Sanders for his boldness, just as they did in 2016.\n\nAnother reason Sanders made it through the night: the nature of the criticisms of him. Attacking him from the left, as Biden did on guns, may score a debate point but isn't going to convince people that Biden is the more committed progressive. Sanders owns that territory. While Biden's attack on Sanders over his praise for the Cuban government was correct in its gist---he has been an apologist and contextualizer for left-wing dictators---the details were mistaken and won't hold up as the argument is litigated in coming days. Like Donald Trump in 2016, Sanders is also in the enviable position of being able to tell the voters he's courting that all the attacks on him are just proof that he is upsetting the establishment. 'For the most part, Sanders was able to avoid getting stuck defending himself. He answered nearly every criticism by returning to a familiar riff about billionaires. (He's against them. ) That tack won't work if he's the nominee. Voters at large are much more hostile to socialism, at home and abroad, than Democratic voters are. But it was enough to keep him just as secure in the front-runner position as he was at the start of the night.\n\nPete Buttigieg got off the best line when he said Sanders has 'nostalgia for the revolution politics of the '60s.  He was the only candidate on the stage who had a strategy to try and derail Sanders's momentum. He did what he could. But everybody else was just so lousy at it. Or, in the case of Warren, too wrapped up in her misty water-colored memories of her triumph over Bloomberg last week to pay attention to the guy who is actually eating her lunch---the guy who has every reason to think (no matter what happens in South Carolina) that he is heading inexorably for the center stage in Milwaukee.\n\nThere were three moments over the course of the night when Sanders and Buttigieg clashed in a serious, sustained way. In the first two, Buttigieg tried to make his point with the sort of rational 'Let's talk about that' lines that are his hallmark. And Sanders shouted at himover and over. Until Buttigieg eventually gave up and let Sanders have the floor. The third time this happened, Buttigieg forged ahead and didn't back down. But because he wasn't willing to raise his voice, Sanders shouted over him and drowned him out. This is Bernie's move. It's how he deals with being challenged. But ask yourself: Do you think Sanders is going to be better at dominance politics than Trump is? Because I'm not sure I'd like his chances in that matchup. 'Biden was feisty and sharp. He showed voters that he's a fighter and emphasized over and over the idea of getting things done. He hit Bernie early for having wanted to primary Barack Obama in 2012 and had a great line when asked about his support from African-Americans: 'I don't expect anything. I'm here to earn the vote. At this point, Biden is a clear underdog. But he sure looks like the strongest challenger to Sanders.\n\nFinally, 'Mike Bloomberg cleared the exceptionally low bar of, 'better than last week.  He had some painfully unfunny planned jokes that landed with a thud, and when the topics turned to his weaknesses like stop-and-frisk and nondisclosure agreements with former employees, he looked tense. But Bloomberg had some good moments, and he's getting a bit more comfortable as the capitalist defender of charter schools and skeptic on marijuana legalization. The mood of the rest of the field is forcing Bloomberg to be the contrarian, which fits him. Bloomberg has few problems that can't be mitigated by another couple hundred million in television ads."

Some version of what DeSantis represents has the greatest odds of coaxing the party away from Trump and forging a new political synthesis that bears the unmistakable stamp of Trump while jettisoning his flaws. 'This critique of Trump wouldn't be that he tweeted foolish things or violated norms or disgraced himself after the 2020 election. It would be, for example, that he elevated Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, early in the pandemic and listened to his advice for too long. 'The case against Trump would be that, despite all his talk of building the border wall, he didn't get it done and left a desperately flawed immigration system intact, even though he had two years of a Republican Congress. That he rattled China's cage but didn't make fundamental changes to the U. S. trading relationship and said things that were much too complimentary of President Xi Jinping. That, finally, he lost to Joe Biden, a desperately flawed candidate who only made it into the White House because Trump made himself so unpopular.\n\nFor the duration of the response, DeSantis always took the lead in announcing Covid policy. Trump outsourced his Covid policymaking to Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the healthcare bureaucracy. By the time it went sidewaysbecause it solely focused on eradicating a virus that was never getting eliminatedit was too late. The media was solidly on the side of Fauci and Birx simply because their narrative opposed Trump's. 'Now rather than giving the media (that he supposedly detests) fodder to divide Republicans by making every member of the GOP take a side, maybe Trump should knock it off. There is an election in 2022 before anyone needs to worry about 2024. Plus, he's getting in the age range where buying green bananas is risky. Perhaps he should consider taking on the role of the America First kingmaker rather than sending the country careening toward a grudge match with Hillary Clinton in 2024. Trump's pride and need for fealty do not supersede the need to maintain GOP leadership in Florida and retake the House to end the disastrous Biden agenda. 'Stacey Lennox, PJ MediaOthers note, 'I called former national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, who has been down to Mar-a-Lago and on the phone with the former president. Had he heard this chatter? O'Brien went on the record: 'I've never heard any such thing,  he declared on my radio show Thursday. I also checked in with longtime DeSantis supporters. Sources close to the governor confirm O'Brien's account: 'There is no conflict. Zero tension. 'Addiction is a terrible thing to break, and Trump addiction is particularly strong among scribblers and talking heads. But, as for the alleged feud, as Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, there's no there there. Yes, everyone would like to have a do-over on virus response. DeSantis's musings about what he might have done differently in 2020 got catapulted from a serious reflection by a serious man into a tawdry bit of nonnews, especially compared to the real deal of 'minor incursion.

        "document": "Some news outlets view a trove of stolen emails and photographs as the starting point for an investigation; other news outlets view the same material as something worthy of nearly immediate publication. Like all slapdash political scandal stories, the New York Post's version leaves the reader with more questions than answers. 'Did the 'opportunity' turn into an actual meeting? What, precisely, was the role of Pozharskyi? What was he working on? What of the computer that the email was recovered from? (It was dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop and supposedly belongs to Hunter Biden. ) And what did the New York Post know about all this? . 'Not enough to satisfy New York Post journalists, apparently. As reported by Katie Robertson of the New York Times, the story's main author, veteran staffer Bruce Golding, declined to attach his byline to the piece over credibility concerns, as did at least one colleague. According to the Times, one of the bylined authors---Gabrielle Fonrouge---learned that she'd been credited only after the story was published. The other by-line belongs to Emma-Jo Morris, who had no previous New York Post bylines.\n\nThe Biden campaign denied that any substantive meeting occurred between the then-vice president and claims that there are no records of it. Biden's foreign policy and energy advisers also said that they'd never heard of Pozharskyi; there's a possibility, perhaps, that the Ukrainian executive briefly met Biden at a public event, several of which were scheduled for the vice president on the day in question. (Hunter Biden had previously arranged for a potential business partner from China to shake hands with his father in the lobby of a Beijing hotel. ) But so far, it doesn't look like the meeting described in this email happened at all. 'There are also strong indicators that Russia had something to do with this whole affair, though nothing has surfaced definitively proving this is the case. In January, the same Russian intelligence unit that hacked Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic National Committee's emails in 2016 was also able to infiltrate Burisma's systems. 'U. S. intelligence analysts subsequently picked up chatter indicating that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked as part of an October surprise aimed at influencing the election. Analysts were further concerned that forged materials might be included in the leaksomething that, without the original materials in question, journalists can't verify for themselves, leaving everyone to take the New York Post's word.\n\nSo far, the Hunter Biden laptop affair is a farcical retread of the Russian hack-and-leak operation that helped torpedo Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations in 2016. Now, as then, the Trump campaign appears to be hoping that the media will dribble out stolen private messages over the final weeks of the campaign, creating an illusion of scandal where none exists. And now, as then, someone in Trump's inner circle is working directly with someone who is, at least according to the U. S. government, a Russian agent. 'The provenance of the alleged hard drive is murky, and the F. B. I. is reportedly investigating whether it's linked to a foreign disinformation campaign. Giuliani claims his lawyer got it from a Delaware computer repair shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, who says someone he thinks was Hunter Biden dropped off three laptops and never picked them up. Mac Isaac gave a halting interview to several journalists last week; The Daily Beast published the audio, so you can hear for yourself as his story shifts over the course of an hour. If there's an important story here, it's almost certainly about Giuliani's dirty tricks, not any wrongdoing by Joe Biden.\n\nWhat's clear, beyond the false scandal-mongering, has been evident for years: Hunter Biden made a mistake getting involved with a dubious company like Burisma. But the notion that the Burisma affair undermines Joe Biden's case to be president is, as he would say, malarkey. 'Joe Biden said in January it was a 'mistake' for his son to join the board, and promised that if he becomes president, none of his family members will have 'any involvement with any foreign government at all.  Hunter Biden, too, said he made a 'mistake' for which he bore 'full responsibility.  That's the sort of self-criticism we rarely hear from Trump or his family. This is smoke without a fire.\n\nMuch is unknown about the Trump family's business overseaspast and present. While serving in the White House, Ivanka obtained fast-track approval of trademarks in China for fashion gear, beauty services, and voting machines. (Yes, voting machines. ) She also received quick okays for trademarks in Japan. 'According to the New York Times, the tax records the paper unearthed reveal that Trump, in the first two years of his presidency, received millions of dollars from projects in foreign countries, including $1 million from Turkey, $3 million from the Philippines, and $2. 3 million from India. Has Trump been involved with those projects as president? Let's see all the emails. Last year, Donald Jr. visited Indonesia to work with a Indonesian billionaire on a hotel project for the family businessand declared there was no connection between this deal and his dad's foreign policy actions. (At one point, the project had Chinese financing. ) Let's see all the emails about this, too."

It is half a century since the US stopped bombing Laos, having dropped more than 2m tons of cluster munitions; decades on, people then unborn are still paying the price. On one estimate, it will take another 100 years to fully clear the country. This is the true cost of cluster munitions.\n\nThe argument is that, however significant the risks and long-term costs of using cluster bombs, civilians will pay a far higher price where Russian forces prevail. Cluster munitions are effective in combating dug-in ground troops, like the Russian forces along the vast frontline.\n\nBut the same, of course, could be said for chemical weapons, and the US rightly finished destroying its remaining stockpile of those on Friday. Efficacy is why bans on such arms are needed in the first place. Russia's use of them is not a reason to further drag down international norms.\n\nTo suggest that cluster bombs can be used discretely against military targets in Ukraine is an illusion. The lesson from Laos and the consensus of all nations who have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions is that there is no responsible use of cluster bombs. This consensus emerged out of intense research and study of the actual failure rates of cluster munitions in warfare. Any use of cluster bombs in Ukraine by any of the parties to the conflict will extend the human suffering well past the end of military hostilities.\n\nSome argue, 'Let's get real: Ukraine's democratically elected leaders, whose relatives, friends and neighbors are in the line of fire, are more mindful of minimizing Ukrainian casualties than are self-appointed humanitarians in the West watching the war on television. We need to respect their decision.\n\nCluster munitions remain a lawful instrument of warfare for countries that haven't signed the 2008 convention, and Kyiv has shown itself a responsible steward of all the Western weaponry it has received. Zelensky and his generals are, in fact, so worried about needless loss of life that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is progressing too slowly for the liking of some observers in the West. Unlike the Putin regime, the Zelensky government is not willing to butcher its own men in human-wave attacks. Using cluster munitions has the potential to save the lives of many Ukrainian soldiers."

S. diplomat, said that, while he could have worded it differently, what Biden said was truthful, noting opposition figures like Alexei Navalny who have been targeted and Russia's invasion of Crimea. 'I have little sympathy for the Russian expressions of feigned outrage and a great deal of sympathy for President Biden who is making a point, and he is saying let's call things by their name,  Fried said. 'Biden's approach is seen in part as an effort to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who did not forcefully push back on Russia for interfering in U. S. elections. 'It means the tenor of the relations has changed. It means that we're not talking nice about Putin and the Kremlin anymore and were not papering over what they're doing,  said Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia under former President Obama. 'The Russians now will have to decide whether they want the tenor and the actual relationship to improve because they would have to stop all the things they are doing,  Farkas added.\n\nOver and over, Trump was presented with questions about the frequency with which critics of Putin met with untimely ends. And over and over, Trump demurred, either shrugging at others' concerns or equating Putin's behavior with that of the United States. 'He kills journalists that don't agree with him,  Joe Scarborough said to Trump. 'Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe,  Trump replied. 'Nobody has proven that he's killed anyone,  Trump said on ABC's 'This Week.  He offered an odd addendum: 'You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. It has not been proven that he's killed reporters. \n\nBiden's conclusion is surely informed by the Kremlin's recent attempt to kill the Russian pro-democracy opposition figure Alexei Navalny last year and UK-based Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. Still, it's noteworthy to hear a president openly agree another world leader is a 'killer.  For example, when then-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked Trump the same question in 2017, Trump's response was: 'You think our country is so innocent?  and 'I do respect Putin. 'It's clear, then, that Biden is no fan of the Kremlin leader and is currently in no rush to improve US-Russia ties. However, he did conclude the Russia segment by noting both countries can work together when their interests align, citing the five-year extension of the New START nuclear arms control deal between the two countries earlier this year. Put together, the Biden administration will remain tough on Russia and Putin in particular. But if they can find areas of mutual interest, then Washington and Moscow might be able to put their differences aside---at least temporarily. 'Alex Ward, VoxSome note that, 'Generally speaking, when you call someone a killer, you follow it up with action, though as the recent case of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman shows, that's not the case for everyone. Similarly to its handling of the investigation of MBS's role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Biden administration has declassified an intelligence finding that Russia's FSB security agency was behind the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has announced new sanctions against a number of Russian officials in response, but none targeting Putin himself. (The Russian president is in direct control of the FSB. ). 'Ultimately the 'killer' affair may have more to do with domestic politics in both countries than foreign policy. All Biden really did was repeat a story he's been telling for years, and concur with his own intelligence agencies' assessments of Putin's activities. But by choosing to do it, he did draw a contrast with Trump. 'The Trump years opened up a wide partisan gap in U. S. views on Putin, and it's hard to imagine Biden will suffer politically for criticizing the Russian leader, no matter how glibly. As for Putin, he's been using international crises to deflect attention from problems at home for decades now."

        "document": "Polls show the vast majority of Americans agree with Vindman that the Trump-Zelensky call 'was inappropriate.  They agreed with Vindman before he testified. But only a minority of Americans say Trump's conduct warrants impeachment and removal. And the hearings are not changing their minds. Indeed, support for the impeachment inquiry has ticked down since the hearings began, as has the number of Americans tuning in to watch. That means Democrats are failing to convince Americans that Trump's misconduct rises to the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. In blackjack, the tie goes to the dealer; in impeachment, the tie goes to the president. If Republicans fight Democrats to a draw, Trump wins.\n\nDemocrats on the Intelligence Committee have spent the vast majority of their impeachment hearings trying to persuade voters that bureaucrats believe Donald Trump is impulsive, self-serving, and misguided---all of which is unsurprising, and completely irrelevant to the matter at hand. Fiona Hill ended up making a compelling case that she, and others, disapproved of the White House's haphazard handling of foreign policy. But she offered no evidence of 'bribery. Everything we know now that matters we already knew when first reading the report of Trump's call with Volodymyr Zelensky. Either you believe Trump should be impeached for asking a foreign leader to investigate his opponent's son for corruption or you do not.\n\nNot one witness offered any direct evidence that President Trump did anything clearly impeachable. No one heard him order a quid pro quo, in which Ukraine would gin up 'dirt' on Joe Biden in exchange for US aid or a White House meeting. Not one offered a convincing reason why Trump's interest in having Ukraine probe potential corruption warrants impeachment, even if it was part of quid pro quo. Fact is, Ukrainians were involved in the 2016 election, particularly in the investigation into Paul Manafort. And payments to Biden's son Hunter by notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma do reek.\n\nThe claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election 'is supported by significant evidence. It includes public professions of support for Clinton and opposition to Trump by Ukrainian officials. It includes acknowledgments by Ukrainian investigators that their Obama administration counterparts encouraged them to investigate Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bolstering this theory is the fact that Ukrainian officials leaked information damaging to Manafort (a ledger of payments, possibly fabricated) that forced Manafort's ouster from the Trump campaign, triggering waves of negative publicity. 'A Ukrainian court, in late 2018, concluded that two Ukrainian officials meddled in the election. And in 2018 House testimony, Nellie Ohr---who worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign opposition research firm that produced the lurid and discredited Steele dossier---conceded that a pro-Clinton Ukrainian legislator was a Fusion informant. When Republicans and most Trump supporters refer to evidence of Ukrainian collusion in the 2016 election, it is this collusion theory that they are speaking about. This theory is in no way mutually exclusive with the finding that Russia hacked the DNC accounts---it has nothing to do with the hacking. There is nothing illogical in believing both that Russia hacked the Democrats and that Ukraine supported the Democrats.\n\nSome agree that 'the Democrats have their quid pro quo. Even if Trump never explicitly stated that military aid was dependent on Ukraine's investigations, Sondland said that 'everyone was in the loop' and acted under the impression that that was, in fact, the situation. Sondland seems to be making a calculated bet that Trump won't walk away from impeachment unscathed. Just look at how many times he's changed his story. First, he insisted that there was no quid pro quo. Then, he admitted he had actually communicated the quid pro quo. And now, Sondland is throwing the White House under the bus and claiming that he knew of but was powerless to stop a quid pro quo. Sondland's testimony proves that Trump's motivations were personal and that the president did put U. S. national security interests at risk for the sake of political gain.\n\nYet many argue that 'this isn't a quid pro quo that comes close to meeting the definition of bribery. It's another case of Mr. Trump's volatile policy-making based on personal impulse or prejudice, but it's not an impeachable offense. Sondland's account essentially confirms that Mr. Trump had a negative view of Ukraine, was reluctant to keep supplying U. S. aid, and asked Mr. Sondland and others to work with Rudy Giuliani to press Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce that he was opening an anti-corruption probe. Democrats might have advanced their cause with hearings and a censure resolution. Instead, they have unleashed the dogs of impeachment without impeachable offenses."

According to a recent survey, 74% of Americans, including 56% of Republicans, want Washington to do more.\n\nSmall and medium-size businesses and their employees would benefit immediately from reauthorizing the highly successful Paycheck Protection Program. This $669 billion program provided forgivable loans to more than five million businesses to support payroll costs. Recent estimates suggest PPP, with an average loan size of only $101, 000, may have supported as many as 51 million jobs, and saved as many as 13. 6 million. 'In addition to what's in the proposed $908 billion bill President Trump has proposed additional support to households similar to what was offered in the CARES Act. Single tax filers received a $1, 200 rebate; married couples filing jointly received twice that; and every child added $500 to the rebate total. Unemployed workers also received a significant supplement to unemployment insurance. 'By targeting income replacement for the most vulnerable households, such household support would help ensure that consumer spending70% of U. S. outputis resilient to potential labor market weakness in coming months.\n\nIt's absurd to push a relief bill without direct stimulus as a component. For one thing, all sides agree on the need for it, and for another, selling spending like this without giving direct aid to voters is political malpractice. 'Pelosi and Schumer have now signaled that they will come down significantly from their earlier demands, which has been the biggest obstacle to the passage of a Phase 4 relief bill. Republicans need to wrap this up as quickly as possible to get funding in place for vaccine distribution, and everyone can go home for the Christmas holiday with a small win in their pocket after all.\n\nSome, however, argue, 'This new $908 billion compromise is 'only' 40 percent of the size of the Heroes Act, but it is still disconnected from what is happening in the real world. It is renewing many problematic programs fueled by the belief, I am sure, that the economy can stay on ice for months as long as it is sustained by government spending. I am sure the restaurants that benefited from PPP but have closed permanently have a different perspective on this issue. 'State revenues fell less than feared and are going up again. What's more, since 1975, the unemployment rate has averaged 6. 3 percent---it is forecast to be 6. 8 percent for November. I am sorry, but extending and expanding UI---at a scale that is out of whack with past expansions---when the unemployment rate is close to the historical average is simply wrong. 'Lastly 1. 7 percent of this bill---or $16 billion according to the COVID Framework document presented this morning---is specifically about manufacturing vaccines, distribution, and testing. If spending bills are a reflection of politicians' priorities, Americans are getting a clear signal that these politicians have incredibly messed-up priorities with very little focus on what should matter the most right now. This compromise is about business as usual. It's about spending money on the stuff politicians always want to spend money on. The fact that some Democrats are willing to spend less than they wanted and that Republicans are willing to spend more than they should is not noble. It's politics."

        "topic": "Bloombergs Candidacy",
        "stance": "right",
        "document": "In an ominous report Wednesday, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg came in first in a poll in Arkansas. No one has yet assessed the sheer amount of money he is spending. He may spend more on Facebook than Klobuchar will spend on her entire campaign. 'But Bloomberg's problem was made vivid this week as his past comments about stop and frisk policing in Black neighborhoods received widespread condemnation. The massive, well-executed Bloomberg ad campaign may crash and burn on the reality of the true Bloomberg. As an old adage goes, the ads failed because they worked. A good ad campaign kills a bad product fast---because it gets more people to try it. Bloomberg may have a clever 'buy the White House' idea. But it may be that the country gets vaccinated by Bloomberg himself, and the billions he spends in the end can't move people once their minds are made up.\n\nMost critics argue the recording from 2015 will make it difficult for him to attract far-left liberals and black voters, and some think it could be fatal to his chances. I don't think that's true. He was a successful mayor without seriously compromising his blunt style, and New Yorkers generally liked that about him, even when they disagreed. 'Assuming the issue recedes, I think he has a good chance of landing the most important endorsement of all---Barack Obama's. The two have been allies, if not friends, and Obama did not endorse Bloomberg's black Democratic opponent in 2009, Bill Thompson, instead using an appearance with Bloomberg to call him an 'outstanding mayor'. Obama has let it be known that he does not want Bernie Sanders to get the party's nomination. If Bloomberg can manage to make himself Sanders' top opponent, it's easy to imagine Obama leading the establishment in backing him, which would go a long way toward securing the nomination.\n\nSome posit that 'There's a lot that can and should be said about Bloomberg's comments. First, the stop-and-frisk policy Bloomberg was advocating for was of questionable necessity. When New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio did away with the policy a few years ago, many conservatives expressed concern that de Blasio was effectively handicapping the city's law enforcement. But. crime in the city continued to decrease significantly---even without stop and frisk. 'And it should go without saying that Bloomberg is engaging in deliberate racial profiling and that this is wrong and shameful. This mindset should give any reasonable person pause, and it should call into question Bloomberg's ability to lead a diverse country that is already divided. With that said, the timing of when this audio was released reveals something about the Democratic Party and the war for the black vote among its presidential candidates.\n\nOthers argue that 'There are some legitimate civil liberties concerns about 'stop-and-frisk', although living in a city the size of New York comes with some loss of personal freedoms. But the application of 'stop-and-frisk' was not motivated by race, it was motivated by policing where the crime is. It's was what Thomas Sowell called disparity rather than discrimination. There are electoral reasons conservatives might want to help paint Bloomberg as racist, even if they don't really believe it. This trolly approach with its healthy dose of schadenfreude is understandable, but it's also wrong. The larger opportunity here is to use this incident to expose how irrational leftist definitions of racism are.\n\nIt is too bad that Bloomberg has to tar the Stop and Frisk program with such over the top generalizations of who commits murder. What Bloomberg also misses out on is that while there are good reasons to disarm criminals, poor minorities, the very people who are most likely victims of violent crime, are the ones who benefit the most from carrying concealed handguns. Bloomberg's claim doesn't distinguish between law-abiding blacks who want to protect themselves and the criminals. 'President Trump's moves on criminal justice reform, coupled with historically low minority unemployment rates, are already threatening to make inroads on minority voting. A Bloomberg nomination might make these inroads even greater and set the stage for a resounding electoral victory by Trump."
