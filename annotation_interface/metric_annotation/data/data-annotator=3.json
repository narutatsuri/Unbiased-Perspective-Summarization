        "document": "Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi tolerated little public debate or dissent. She thrilled her base with such infamous performative acts as tearing up a State of the Union Address of then-President Trump. As an all-powerful speaker, she oversaw a series of party-line votes with little opportunity for amendments or even to read some bills. Many Republicans did not want the Pelosi model of an all-powerful speaker. For these members, the agreement with McCarthy is a type of Magna Carta.\n\nI have worked in the House in various roles since I was a House leadership page in the 1970s and, much later, represented the House in litigation. I've watched the body become less transparent, less deliberative, with every passing year. Today's legislative system is a mockery of the deliberative process, characterized by runaway spending, blind voting and perfunctory debates. You can dislike or denounce the holdouts while still admitting they have a point---Congress has got to change.\n\nThe House now will supposedly vote on all twelve individual appropriations bills and require 72 hours for members to review bills, provisions aimed at ending the horror-show 'omnibus' spending bills routinely presented as 'must pass' legislation hard against some deadline or holiday. McCarthy also agreed that fiscal year 2024 domestic discretionary spending won't be higher than it was in fiscal year 2022.\n\nChip Roy pushed for many of these changes and has a compelling vision for how a House should work with more power for the rank-and-file, all toward his goal of reducing federal spending. He played a commendable role in the speaker fight over the last week and, importantly, was willing to take 'yes' for an answer.\n\nUnfortunately, the divisions displayed this week make it look pretty unlikely the tiny Republican majority will be able to pull off most of the goals that the holdouts and the regulars agree on. It's not remotely clear that 218 (of just 222) House Republicans can agree on any given spending bill: The hard-liners want major cuts, immediately; at least a few moderates won't go along. 'Maybe McCarthy and his leadership team can scrape up a few Democratic votes for a budget that keeps spending growth nearly flat, though the new rules guarantee that'll be a huge slog rife with challenges that force votes on ousting the speaker. Some see the need to raise the federal debt ceiling as a prime opportunity to force some fiscal discipline. Maybe so, but that'll still require GOP unity on some less-than-ideal proposal---because if the standoff goes on too long, 'soft' Republicans will break and force some deal that protects their interests."

        "stance": "left",
        "document": "On just about every item, the appropriation is inadequate to the level of need. Democrats should certainly push for better terms (extending the enhanced unemployment benefits beyond four months, or tying them to some objective measure of labor-market conditions such as the unemployment rate, seems like an especially worthwhile place to push). But it's not clear to me how Democrats end up with a much better deal than this. 'If they do not sweep the Georgia Senate election runoffs in January, then Mitch McConnell will still control the Senate when Biden takes office, while Nancy Pelosi will preside over a much slimmer House majority than she does now. I see little basis for believing that Democrats will be able to get better terms from this new Congress than they have from the current one. 'More important, America's most vulnerable cannot wait two months for aid. And from a macroeconomic perspective, an ounce of recession prevention is worth a pound of cure. If America enters a recessionary spiral---with job losses leading to lower consumer spending, leading to more job losses---the fiscal cost of helping every constituency that Democrats wish to aid will rise substantially.\n\nProbably the most controversial aspect of the proposal is its omission of another round of direct payments to households, though this is defensible given its inclusion of $26 billion in additional nutritional aid for low-income families. Imperfect as it is, the bipartisan proposal merits support both in substantive terms and political ones. 'Substantively, it is better---much better---than nothing, which is what the 10 million who remain jobless, and the 26 million facing food insecurity, are getting now. Politically, it shows the way to yes for the negotiators, Mr. Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif. ), and puts pressure on them to get there. Things might have been easier if Ms. Pelosi had shown more flexibility before the election; they'd be easier now if Mr. McConnell would budge from his maximum of $500 billion and if Mr. Trump would press for legislation instead of ranting about vote fraud. Cooler heads must prevail lest eight months of hard-won economic progress be allowed to unravel.\n\nCritics of the bill, however, posit that 'Unable to pass the federal liability shield legislation on its own, lawmakers from both parties have now come together in a grand show of post-election bipartisan unity to help their corporate donors create a hostage situation that's something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie. Their proposal predicates long overdue and desperately needed unemployment assistance on the condition that corporations are given a get-out-of-jail-free card. corporate managers were allegedly betting on the number of COVID deaths that would happen at a meatpacking plant. 'With liability shields, those same employers will know that they can get away with all kinds of cost-slashing and corner-cutting that endangers workers and denies them access to basic protective gear. In other words, corporations will know they can drive the COVID body count ever higher, and they won't even have to worry about being called into a courtroom to answer for their crimes. 'The shield would strip frontline workers of their last remaining legal tool to protect themselves in the workplace---at the same that time the unemployment system is designed to financially punish those workers if they refuse to return to unsafe workplaces during the pandemic.\n\nComing in at just over $900 billion, the bipartisan proposal moved substantially away from what Democrats want (around $2 trillion) and a whole lot closer to what Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) has pushed for (around $500 billion). Naturally, the Senate majority leader responded to this dramatic move in his direction by immediately announcing that this compromise is a non-starter. 'By reaching this agreement with Republicans, a group of Democratic senators made it easier for McConnell to demand that they move still further in his direction once he tries to jam them with his proposal in the upcoming funding bill. Now the 'compromise' position has moved to a point between $900 billion and $500 billion. Which raises a question: Is there any serious utility at all in Democratic senators seeking compromise with Republicans, even ones who appear to be acting in good faith, if there's simply no chance that it will meaningfully influence McConnell, and if it's preordained that McConnell will simply seize on this to his tactical advantage?"

        "document": "The previous prosecution team had argued that Stone's conduct merited various hefty enhancements in what's known as the 'offense level' (basically, how serious the offense is and how stiff a sentence it should get). The initial prosecutors argued that Stone's conduct deserved these enhancements because it involved threats of causing someone physical injury, substantial interference with the administration of justice, and attempted obstruction of the prosecution (via Stone's social media postings, including of a picture of crosshairs over Judge Jackson's image), and was extensive in scope. 'Barr confirmed that the decision to water down the initial prosecutors' requested sentence for Stone came from the highest levels of the Justice Department---and while he argued his decision was justified on the merits, the move raises questions about whether friends of the president have different standards applied to them by Justice Department leaders. 'Andrew Prokop, Vox\n\nEven the Justice Department's extraordinary decision to reverse course the next day noted that the guidelines 'enhancements'---the factors that led to the original sentencing recommendation---were 'perhaps technically applicable,  and prosecutors on Thursday did not dispute the applicability of those enhancements. In other words, Mr. Barr and those carrying out his wishes did not really dispute the facts and the law as carefully laid out by the career prosecutors. Instead, they presented a litany of the arguments that Mr. Stone's own lawyers had made for ignoring the guidelines and giving him lenient treatment. 'Here's a question the Justice Department has not answered: Can it point to a single case in which the defendant was not an ally of President Trump, or someone who could testify against the president, where the department overruled career prosecutors to ask for a sentence 'far less' than that called for by the sentencing guidelines in a case that went to trial? Maybe for a drug offender? Or someone who broke immigration laws?\n\nMr. Trump has claimed that the Constitution gives him 'the right to do whatever I want.  His lawyers have argued in a federal case involving his tax returns that a sitting president cannot even be investigated. They have also, in a head-spinning assertion of executive authority, dismissed any efforts by Congress to hold the president and the executive branch accountable. 'Characteristically, while interfering in the justice system, Mr. Trump is both insisting he's doing nothing of the sort and asserting his right to do so. 'Just so you understand, I chose not to be involved,  he said Tuesday in response to a question about his meddling in Mr. Stone's case. 'I'm allowed to be totally involved. If there is anything useful to draw from Mr. Trump's degradation of the rule of law and the powers of his office, it's that he is exposing a critical vulnerability in the Constitution's design, which anticipated presidents behaving badly, but not this badly.\n\nIt's now time to ask: In a free society, dedicated to the rule of law, does it really make sense to say that the attorney general of the United States serves at the president's whim? . In many of the states, the attorney general is independent of the governor and the system seems to work well, or well enough. Congress should transform the Justice Department into an independent agency, legally immunized from the president's day-to-day control. the argument for an independent Justice Department seems at least as compelling as the argument for an independent Federal Reserve Board or Federal Communications Commission."

There was no evidence of fraud in Philadelphia. 'Absolute rubbish,  Barr said. There was no evidence of a big vote dump in Detroit. Barr said Trump actually did better there in 2020 than in 2016.\n\nThe concerns of a truck driver that he had delivered fraudulent ballots were investigated and dismissed. Misleading video shared online from Georgia was not of a suitcase of fraudulent ballots, but rather the normally used lockbox. Dominion voting machines were not fraudulent. Barr said 'idiotic claims' had been made in a sensational way to influence people.\n\nTrump's former campaign manager Bill Stepien described Trumpworld as being divided after the election was called, between 'Team Normal'---those who accepted the result of the election---and those aligned with former NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani's efforts to overturn the election.\n\nEric Herschmann, a Trump White House lawyer who defended the former president on the Senate floor during the first impeachment and another member of 'Team Normal,  bluntly told the committee during his interview, 'What they were proposing, I thought was nuts.  He added, 'I mean, it was a combination of Italians, Germans, I mean, different things floating around as to who was involved. Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelans. something with the Philippines, just all over the radar. Barr, along with other administration officials, described playing 'whack-a-mole' with Trump's false claims of fraud.\n\nAgain and again, reality was presented to him, but Trump acted as if it did not exist. Is this because he cannot recognize reality or because he doesn't want to recognize reality for assorted transactional purposes? So far, the committee has not provided an authoritative answer. But that may be above its pay grade.\n\nIn any event, there is a fundamental truth that transcends resolution of this issue: Whether or not Trump believes in his Big Lie, he has successfully encouraged millions of Americans to do so, and that includes the thousands who assaulted the Capitol on January 6. In either case, Trump is a threat to the republic.\n\nThe committee heard Monday from a cavalcade of former officials who worked for President Donald Trump around the time of the 2020 election. They all wanted Mr. Trump to win. Yet they all testified that they were confident that the election was not stolen and that they told Mr. Trump so.\n\nAnyone in Trumpworld with a shred of intellectual honesty apparently concluded that the claims of Mr. Trump and other 2020 crackpots were obviously false---'bull---t,  as former attorney general William P. Barr put it. The lesson is that, in the age of social media and hyper-partisanship, it is unsettlingly easy to manufacture national crises out of absolutely nothing.\n\nAmericans have long had the luxury of voting for leaders based on day-to-day issues such as economic performance or tax, education or environmental policy, because the major parties' nominees have shared commitments to basic facts and to the U. S. political system. We no longer have that luxury. Voters must now prioritize honesty on core issues and commitment to democracy above all else. If we fail to repudiate politicians who lie or who amplify lies about U. S. democracy, more will do so. Whether we have another 2020---or worse---in 2024 depends heavily on what voters do this November."

        "document": "Of course Fox News didn't run with the story as soon as Giuliani served it up. Something that inflammatory showing up a few weeks before the election couldn't simply be dumped out to the public without checking into it. But people did check and have since found two people copied on some of the emails who verified their authenticity. Then they reported on it with that supporting testimony to back it up. 'If the FBI had found anything tying the laptop to the Russians we'd probably have heard about it by now. I'll even concede that it's still possible that some bad actors, be they foreign or domestic, could theoretically have been involved in making the contents of Hunter Biden's hard drive available as some sort of oppo project. 'But at the end of the day, the only real question is whether or not the emails are real and if they were composed by Hunter Biden. Neither Hunter nor his father's campaign has once tried to deny the authenticity of the emails. And the previously mentioned confirmation offered by other recipients of the messages pretty much seals the deal.\n\nEven if the information had been hacked, that would not make it inauthentic. The reason hacking is a serious offense that causes humiliation and wreaks financial and privacy havoc is because it exposes true information. The hacked Democratic National Committee emails were a problem for Democrats in 2016 because they were real. Media outlets published stories about them, and the Obama administration confronted the Russian regime over them, because the emails were authentic. Hacking is a bad thing. but there's nothing about it that makes the stolen information suspect. 'The Biden campaign's initial reaction was to check the former vice president's official calendar---after which the campaign first lamely said there was no notation of any such meeting, and then meekly admitted that Biden might well have met with the Burisma executive. But notice what they didn't say: Nobody claimed there was no need to check any official calendar because the email was a fake. They assumed it was authentic, because there was no good reason not to. At the moment, the known evidence overwhelmingly tends to establish that the laptop is exactly what it is represented to be: the repository of Hunter Biden's authentic emails, documents, photos and videos.\n\nAccording to the emails, both Bidens were in line in 2017 to benefit from a deal with CEFC. One email. refers to financial payments in terms of '20' for 'H' and '10 held by H for the big guy?  Fox News says it has confirmed the veracity of the email with one of its recipients and that sources say the 'big guy' is Joe Biden. 'Mr. Biden was a private citizen in 2017 but was considering a presidential run. A transaction that would have made himor his sonpartners with an entity tied to the Chinese government raises questions about judgment and how he would handle China as President. Joe Biden ought to clear the air on this China business in his own political interest. 'President Trump, as usual, is muddying the story with inappropriate demands that the Department of Justice investigate a potential crime. But the real burden here should be on Mr. Biden and the press. Perhaps Joe Biden wasn't involved, and Hunter was using his father's name to advance his own business interests. But it's also possible that Joe Biden was aware of the CEFC business and was unwilling to tell his son that he couldn't trade on his father's name and position. Whatever the truth, the public deserves better than Mr. Biden's Trump-like dismissal of the CBS reporter who so far is the only one brave enough to ask about the emails.\n\nDoes anyone remember the Trump-Russia investigation? There were news stories that characterized a handshake and a chat between a figure in the Trump circle and a Russian, such as Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, as 'contacts with Russians' worthy of investigation. Robert Mueller's prosecutors investigated one such meet-and-greet moment at the 2016 Republican convention, taking testimony under oath from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Trump aide J. D. Gordon, and others. Prosecutors also questioned Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner about a handshake and chat with Kislyak. 'Now, when the Biden campaign allows that there might have been an 'informal' and 'cursory' encounter between Joe Biden and an executive from the corrupt Ukrainian company that was paying his son $50, 000 a month to do nearly nothing, much of the political world's reaction is not only to deny the story without investigating but to praise social media companies for banning it.\n\nNothing may be illegal here; voters can decide what to make of it. But it ought to register with you how cravenly some in the mainstream media are trying to convince you something isn't true that they know is true. The New York Post revelations are unlike many things you've seen reported as 'news' lately: There is meticulous, transparent sourcing. 'The technician who ended up in possession of Hunter's laptop is described in detail and has now been identified by name by other news outlets and even outed himself. The named persons of Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon vouched for how the data came into the Post's hands. Compare this to the vague, anonymous sourcing of so many Russia collusion stories or the New York Times's mysteriously sourced 'tax-return data' (not tax returns) of Donald Trump."

        "document": "Cops know that armed suspects most often discard their weapons on first perceiving the arrival of the police. The reason for this is simple: better to ditch the gun than get shot or catch a case for holding onto it (you can always get another one later). 'If an armed suspect doesn't abandon his gun, the pursuing officer has no choice but to assume the suspect intends to use it against him, and any reasonable officer will respond accordingly at the first indication of such intent. Sadly for Toledo, perhaps due to his youth and inexperience, he acted in such a way that his movements were interpreted as preparation to fire rather than discard the gun he carried. 'In Graham v. Connor (1989), the U. S. Supreme Court held that the 'reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  So, viewing the events from this perspective, we have Officer Stillman responding to reported gunshots at 2: 30 a. m. and confronting two males in the immediate vicinity. 'Both of those males refuse to comply with a uniformed police officer's clearly stated orders to stop, and one of them runs nearly the length of a football field before stopping, pulling a gun from his pocket or waistband, and turning toward Stillman. On seeing the gun, Stillman reasonably believed Toledo was preparing to shoot him and fired in self-defense, striking Toledo in the chest.\n\nLess than one second elapsed between Toledo beginning his turn toward the officer with a gun in his right hand and then dropping the gun, and the officer firing a single shot from his service weapon. And these were not ideal conditions in which to make a split-second decision: it was dark, and Stillman's heart rate and adrenaline levels were likely elevated due to the foot chase. 'Was it really so unreasonable for Stillman to have genuinely perceived a risk to his own life when he decided to pull the trigger? I don't think so, but I'm certain of one thing: that's not a question you can answer based on a single, out-of-context freeze-frame. Those who attempt to do so show their extreme ignorance of the realities of dynamic situations like these. 'Such hasty conclusions also reinforce cops' perception, which I suspect is becoming even more widespread, that they should not expect fair treatment if they have the misfortune of being involved in a use-of-force incident. As that perception deepens among cops, we run the risk of more and more officers prioritizing risk-minimization over being proactive. As the past year of escalating crime has shown us, that's a recipe for more tragedy. 'Rafael A. Mangual, City JournalSome argue that 'I hate to second-guess the officer, who was involved in a foot chase and undoubtedly surging with adrenaline, knowing that he was looking for an armed suspect. I hate to do it, but we have to because this sort of thing happens way too often. We also have to second-guess the entire police department because, if not for the body camera, the official record would reflect that Toledo was holding a gun when he was shot by Stillman. When government lawyers tell lies that are contradicted by body camera footage, is it any wonder that people mistrust the police? . 'I am not advocating for defunding the police, but we do need police reform. There are a few ideas that seem like good places to start. The first is to better screen police applicants and weed out people who are too aggressive and combative. Another important reform is better training. Too often, the reaction is to shoot first and ask questions later. Several veterans have made the point that American soldiers serving in combat zones have more strict rules of engagement than police officers patrolling American cities. This needs to change. 'I don't believe that Officer Stillman set out that night to kill a child. I also don't think that he shot Toledo. because he was a minority kid. But the fact remains that Stillman did kill an unarmed seventh-grader."

        "document": "During oral arguments in the case, the five conservative Justices seemed to agree with the Trump Administration that Congress has delegated to the Commerce Secretary broad authority over Census questions. As Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas noted in a related opinion last fall, it's not unconstitutional for cabinet officers to have political motives for a policy. Political appointees also consult with outside experts like Hofeller all the time, as the Obama Administration often did on regulation and litigation. The real goal of flogging the Hofeller memo now is to raise enough of a political stink to intimidate the Supreme Court to block the citizenship question.\n\nThe citizenship question was asked routinely until 1950, after which it was removed from the survey. In the midst of our current immigration crisis, there is certainly very good reason to know how many of the people in the country are citizens, and how many are essentially guests, whether invited or not. The nation ought to be able to have the facts at hand as we decide whether to close the southern border a la Trump or open it per Beto O'Rourke.\n\nEqualizing for citizen population, rather than total population, will have the effect of giving eligible voters equality of electoral power. Consider this: In states with large numbers of noncitizens such as Texas, New York, and California, some state legislative districts may have twice as many eligible voters as adjoining ones. This means districts with fewer citizens have more electoral power than the districts with more citizens. That isn't fair. 'Equalizing districts by the number of citizens prevents some voters from having their votes over-weighted and over-valued, while others are under-weighted and under-valued. If one-person, one-vote---one of our most enduring egalitarian principles---has any meaning, the citizen population gaps in voting districts must not be so glaringly wide. Without census data that includes citizenship status, it is probably not possible for states and smaller jurisdictions to draw election districts that equalize eligible voters.\n\nIt is worth noting that the citizenship question does not ask about a person's legal status; it merely asks about citizenship status and thus has nothing whatsoever to do with immigration enforcement. In fact, federal law prevents census data from being used for anything other than statistical analysis. That is the law and there is no evidence any agency intends to violate it. If there is a legitimate fear at all, it is that media hype may create a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is reckless and irresponsible of elected leaders in our country to give minorities the mistaken impression that they have anything to fear from the census for the sake of political gain.\n\nWhat is odd about the challenge by blue states and liberal advocacy organizations is that even the United Nations. sides with the Trump administration on this issue. In its 2017 'Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses,  the U. N. recommends that member countries ask census questions identifying both an individual's country of birth and country of citizenship. A Commerce Department memorandum on this subject dated March 26, 2018, notes that countries asking a citizenship question on their census include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom."

Legitimately or not, he has been praised for record low unemployment -- now at 3. 7%. That Trump's economic policies are in any way causing manufacturing plants to close and jobs to be eliminated could be a stake in the heart of the Trump presidential experiment. \n\nWhile 'it is largely true that Trump himself is not directly responsible for the layoffs, which will impact 14, 000 workers in Ohio, Michigan, Maryland and Canada, and reflect complicated decisions that appear rooted in lagging sales. the problem for Trump. is that Trump has constantly asserted that such industrial job losses won't occur on his watch. \n\nBut 'even a competent president would not be able to replace all the factory jobs that were lost, because most of them didn't actually move overseas, as is the common refrain. Rather, they were automated. That's why U. S. factories are producing twice as much as they did in 1984, but have shed over 5 million jobs since 1987. That's also why Trump's solution, to impose heavy tariffs on our trading partners, has not worked and has in fact killed more jobs by making everything more expensive. \n\nWhat GM and every competitive American company does is follow the customers. last quarter General Motors sold more vehicles in China than in the United States. Making cars in America for export to China would render them 'structurally unprofitable'. It would be helpful if Trump recognized that being president doesn't make him economy czar. he can't force companies to continue to operate factories that aren't profitable. \n\nAs 14, 000 people and their families fretted looming unemployment, with Christmas just weeks away, investors celebrated. GM stock closed up 5 percent on Monday. This points to the growing disconnect between what's good for Wall Street and what's good for Main Street.

Of course, a lot can change between now and November of next year. And in fairness to Trump, it is true that state-level polls underestimated his support in 2016. It's undeniable, however, that the 2020 polling, taken in its totality, doesn't look good for Trump right now.\n\nThe head-to-head polling doesn't really tell us much about events 18 months in the future, but it does tell us there's no counterintuitive process whereby Trump secures the votes of tons of people who say he's doing a bad job as president. The public is mostly saying they want to vote for any Democrat, and the strongest pattern so far indicates better-known Democrats do better than the more obscure ones. Rather than being either complacent or paralyzed by fear, Democrats should probably take a modest amount of reassurance from Trump's bad polls and try worrying about everything else for a minute.\n\nMany argue that, 'Biden is wrong to imply that if only Trump is gone, Republicans in Congress will immediately negotiate with a Democratic president in good faith. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky. ) brags that he will continue to be the 'grim reaper' and destroy any legislation from a Democratic president, while promising to further pack the Supreme Court if a vacancy arises during an election year. Biden and Democratic candidates for the presidency, House and Senate should run against the hugely unpopular 'grim reaper' McConnell and the Trump Republicans in Washington.  Brent Budowsky, The Hill\n\nDoes Biden believe in his own powers of persuasion? Or is he attempting to woo prized Obama-to-Trump voters, not to mention upscale white suburbanites reported to be appalled by Trump's behavior? . But there's another crowd this stuff appeals to as well, a group that would rather not discuss the economic issues that contributed to Trump's victory. That would be the donor class of the Democratic Party. 'There's lots of evidence to suggest that Biden really does think he brings unique skills at bipartisanship to the presidential table. He did make deals with the Republicans aplenty in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. But they were deals like the Hyde Amendment and bankruptcy 'reform' that made life harder for people in financial trouble or struggling with student debt, though not for the wealthiest. If members of the Democratic donor class are putting their faith in Biden, it's hard to blame them. The real question is whether voters will continue to support Biden as it becomes clearer and clearer that his promise of bipartisanship is simply another, more politically palatable way of saying that the rich will continue to come first.  Helaine Olen, Washington Post\n\nRegarding Buttigieg's speech, some argue, 'He is an heir to Obama's cautious and intellectual worldviewexcept that while Obama was, at heart, a realist influenced by the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr and the actions of Brent Scowcroft, Buttigieg is more motivated by values. Buttigieg is, at heart, a liberal internationalist who is looking beyond interventions to challenges posed by great powers, bridging the gap between the Obama and Clinton wings of his party. He fears that, left untended, threats to liberty abroad will ultimately threaten liberty at home. Buttigieg still has a lot of work to do to unpack what this means, but if he sticks to it and is bolder than he was on Tuesday, he may be able to articulate the alternative he promised.\n\nOthers contend, 'Buttigieg wants to set a generous narrative of national identity against Trump's cramped and cruel vision, and against the progressive hostility to any national identity at all. It won't be easy. He speaks of the compassion of his Indiana neighbors toward refugees, their desire to be part of 'a greater project' than just America First. But the strongest political emotions of the moment are fear, disillusionment, and hatred. As impressive as he is personally, Buttigieg hasn't yet found the words, the music, and the policies to make his appeal convincing.  George Packer, The Atlantic"

Fauci has, in recent days, arrived as a stand-in: a convenient means of savaging the Biden administration without having to attack Biden himself.\n\nThe same researcher who suggested the virus looked 'engineered' in the email in February 2020 concluded several weeks later that the lab leak theory was indeed implausible. 'Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,  the study said, while adding that 'it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here. 'Fauci certainly cast doubt on the lab leak theory. But he generally couched it as there being no real evidence of it, rather the conclusive evidence to disprove it, and he was doing so at a time in which most other scientists were doing the same thing. There is quite simply no evidence that Fauci was delivered anything amounting to solid evidence of a lab leak.\n\nThough the lab leak theory has been embraced more on the political right, Rutgers University biologist Richard Ebright says it was Republican hawks under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney who pushed for the NIH to fund more of the sort of research that could have both health and bioweapons applications---or could be seen as defensive against biological attack. And it was academics on the left who warned this work could endanger our safety in the name of improving it. 'If Fauci owes the public an explanation for anything, it's why he approved funding for research that potentially made viruses more dangerous---so-called gain of function research. Though Fauci has been unofficially anointed America's 'top expert in infectious disease' by the press, his real job is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In that capacity, he's not above criticism. He's approved funding of projects on viruses that other scientists have deemed too risky to be worth doing. 'Faye Flam, BloombergRegarding Fauci's initial advice not to wear masks, 'In February and early March of 2020, anything Covid-19-related was unclear even to health professionals, and a leading line of discourse was that Americans should not wear masks because they weren't thought to be effective in screening out viral particles shed by others. While that information continues to be believed accurate. it was eventually found that encouraging everyone to wear masks helped to prevent the actively infected from spreading the shed viral particles as easily to others. 'There was also an effort to keep the panic-driven public from buying all available masks and putting health care workers at risk of running out of supplies. During a June 3 CNN interview addressing the emails, Fauci reiterated that if he had all the information he had today, his advice from early in the pandemic would be drastically different, and that masks do in fact work. But it doesn't look like Fauci's explanation will ease the backlash."
