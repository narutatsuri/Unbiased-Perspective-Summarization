        "document": "Critics have pejoratively described the bill as 'censorship,  but it is perfectly appropriate to censor adult themes and ideas around small children. Beyond teaching the acceptance of differences, why confuse children under eight years old, most of whom do not yet understand the biology of sexual reproduction? What need is there for schools to introduce young children to the highly contentious metaphysical claim that your sexed body may not be your 'true' gender? If parents wish to discuss these themes with their children, they are of course free to do so. 'These are not hypothetical concerns. In November, the Littlejohn family filed a lawsuit against Leon County School Board in federal district court in Northern Florida, after they were excluded from welfare decisions regarding their 13-year-old daughter. The Littlejohns had informed the school that their daughter was confused about her gender and made clear that they did not consent to social transition. 'However, it later transpired that school staff had held private meetings with her, asking which pronouns she would prefer, which restrooms she would like to use, whether she would like to stay with the boys on overnight trips, and whether they should keep her parents in the dark.\n\nMany parents believe that classroom teachers should not show young, impressionable children pictures that depict breast-binding or encourage physically altering their growing bodies. They don't want children in early elementary grades to read books or use gender-coloring books encouraging them to disassociate their minds from their bodies, and to focus on sex and sexuality at such a young age. 'Young children don't need to be shown a Blue's Clues Pride Parade video celebrating transgenderism and pansexuality, or Queer Kid Stuff videos that train them to ask people for their pronouns, or be told that doctors are sometimes wrong when 'assigning gender.  Children should not be instructed that there is no such thing as girls and boys. Lest this sound like an unlikely scenario: a lawsuit is being filed by a Canadian mother whose six-year-old daughter was taught 'girls are not real, and boys are not real' at school. It's more than understandable that parents have asked legislators to curb such gender-ideology activism in schools. \n\nNo one wants a child to feel 'not valued' or conform to one point of view. The problem is that progressives think their point of view is the only one and everyone else agrees. Otherwise opponents are labeled as homophobic or anti-LGBTQ. What Republicans are pushing for, though, is allowing young children to just be children. 'The teacher can monitor a student-led discussion on LGBTQ issues, should a child bring it up in class, but it will not be allowed to be a routine part of a class's curriculum. A young child may bring up that he or she has two moms, for example, and that can start a conversation in a classroom. It's important that it is an age appropriate discussion. The bill is a simple acknowledgement that very young children should not have to learn about mature topics in early elementary school years."

        "document": "It's no secret that Mr. Trump had a problem with Ms. Nielsen, whom he considered 'weak' on matters of border security. Whatever the secretary's personal views, and no matter how impossible her job, she was the face of some of the administration's most poorly conceived and gratuitously callous policies. At best, she was complicit and, yes, rather weak. 'Editorial Board, New York Times\n\nNielsen carried out 'Trump's ghastly family separation policy at the southern border. and designed a plan that strictly limited the number of asylum-seekers allowed to enter the United States. And she implemented what was ultimately ruled to be an unlawful policy to prevent immigrants from applying for asylum if they entered the country illegally. But Nielsen drew the line at Trump's 'clearly illegal' demands, including 'blocking all migrants from seeking asylum.  She also reportedly refused to resume family separations, despite Trump's entreaties, because she did not want to violate a court order. 'If Nielsen and other DHS officials who were recently fired were not sufficiently extreme, it is alarming to consider what might come after them. Both bent the law as far as they could to implement hugely controversial and frequently vicious policies to further Trump's nativist goals. It wasn't enough for the president. With their ousters, DHS is entering a new era, one in which the agency will do whatever Donald Trump and Stephen Miller think it can get away with.\n\nMany ask, 'Can McAleenan be the 'tough' secretary Trump wants? . McAleenan has praised the effectiveness of U. S. aid to Central America---immediately putting him at odds with the president, who has ordered a cutoff of assistance to those countries. And McAleenan refers to the migrants arriving at the border not as scammers looking to cheat their way into the country but as 'vulnerable families' who need more humanitarian treatment. He has urged a fast and responsible screening process that will let true asylum seekers start their new lives in the United States once a court rules on their claims. Whether that is what the president and Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, are looking for on a long-term basis is not clear.\n\nOthers note that 'the DHS is a sprawling giant of 22 agencies that merged together in the wake of 9/11. The department's 240, 000 employees handle everything from hurricanes to cyber security to border security to terrorism. As secretary of homeland security, a lot of things can happen on your watch: A botched response to a hurricane, or a serious cyber attack, or a major terrorist assault, or rising numbers of migrant families trying to cross the southern border. 'Almost a century ago one such desperate migrant, Mary Anne MacLeod, left the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, one of the most poverty-stricken parts of Europe, to find work as a servant in New York. Mary later married Fred Trump. They had five children, including a son named Donald. Trying to dissuade migrants such as Mary Anne MacLeod from leaving countries where they see no future to seek their fortune in the United States is likely beyond the ken of any secretary of homeland security.\n\nUS immigration law is a balance between the desire to minimize unauthorized entry into the United States and the desire to protect vulnerable people who may be fleeing harm and persecution. Both US and international law prohibit the US from refusing entry to people who are in danger of persecution in their home countries; both US statute and court settlements offer extra due-process protections to asylum seekers, children, and families. Trump's anger at Nielsen is really anger at this delicate balance. if Trump wants a DHS secretary who will stop people from setting foot on US soil, none of the options will satisfy him."

        "topic": "Richard Grenell Appointed Acting DNI",
        "stance": "right",
        "document": "Grenell would be an odd choice if Trump wished to downplay Russian threats. To start, he is a longtime Russia hawk. Last year, for example, he warned German companies building the NordStream II pipeline between Germany and Russia that they would risk U. S. sanctions if they went forward with the project. More important, Grenell himself has said he will only be acting director, and that he expects the president will soon nominate someone else for the position. Intelligence assessments involve the input of 16 agencies and often take months to complete, so it would be near impossible for someone serving as acting director for a short period of time to suppress or alter intelligence products. 'So appointing Grenell may be less an effort to censor intelligence than a bit of hostage politics with the Senate. If the Senate doesn't confirm Trump's nominee, Grenell can serve for months. The two leading candidates for the job are Representative Chris Stewart, a Republican from Utah who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, and Pete Hoekstra, the current ambassador to the Netherlands and former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Both would likely face opposition from Democrats. The White House is hoping to force Democrats to hold their noses and not delay the confirmation.\n\nGrenell is highly unlikely to try and turn the intelligence community into a partisan war horse. Such an effort would fail in face of the institutional impulses those agencies have for the national interest and their mission. Moreover, for all his Twitter comments, Grenell is a patriot. From his seven-year tenure as chief spokesman at the United Nations and his time in Berlin (which has a large CIA station he would have liaised with), Grenell will know that good intelligence is forward-leaning, corroborated, and commensurate with policy-maker needs. 'In Grenell, Trump now has a smart, loyal voice to guide him on matters of national security. But the intelligence community also gets something: a leader with Trump's ear, and someone who is keen to impress. Both sides, then, can forge common ground in America's interest.\n\nThe DNI doesn't have budgetary, personnel, or command authority over the community he overlooks; his job is to assess the intelligence that the IC creates, ask tough questions in an attempt to expose weakness or uncertainty, and present the views of the IC to the president in a useful form. In other words, the DNI is an evaluator, not an operator. Like top political leaders, he consumes rather than produces intelligence. 'There have been five Senate-confirmed DNIs since the job was created. Only two of them (Admiral Mike McConnell and James Clapper) came from the IC. The first DNI---John Negroponte---was a career diplomat and ambassador who went on to be deputy secretary of state. Another, Admiral Dennis Blair, came out of the Surface Navy and was a former commander of the United States Pacific Command. The latest DNI was Dan Coates, a well-respected Senator who had been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The point is that DNIs come from a number of different backgrounds. Grenell has years of international experience at both the U. N. and as ambassador to Germany, as well as in private life. In those capacities, he has had ample opportunity to see the strengths and weaknesses of the IC.\n\nThe attempt to portray the ambassador as some kind of toady betrays the fact the critics' real fear is the president being served by those truly devoted to his agendathat is, that he be afforded the same privileges as every other president. Grenell will no doubt have his work cut out for him in overseeing some who will seek to undercut him to protect their turf from an executive they believe has infringed upon it. But Grenell's experience both in navigating a hostile UN, and grappling with the seminal national security and foreign policy issues of our time in the face of a recalcitrant German government, will no doubt serve him well.\n\nRegarding the intelligence briefing, 'The Republicans' objection was not to the idea that Russia is trying to interfere in a U. S. election. That is an accepted fact. The problem was the assessment that Russia is specifically trying to help reelect Trump. That claim, so incendiary in the 2016 election, was unsupported by the evidence, they said. intelligence officials did not have the evidence to make that assertion, and, almost as soon as the story broke, officials with knowledge of the meeting suggested that the headlines were wrong. On Sunday, CNN reported the officials had apparently 'overstated' the Putin-wants-Trump story. 'And then there were the circumstances of the briefing. The Intelligence Community works for the president. Yet, officials chose to brief Schiff's House Intelligence Committee on this extraordinarily consequential finding before telling the president. Later, just to make matters more difficult, there were leaks that Russia is also trying to help elect Bernie Sanders. The leak left many experts baffled, except to the extent that, with the Trump leak, it seemed to target the Intelligence Community's two least-favorite candidates."

        "document": "Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, won the governor's mansion in 2018 in a tight election. Donald Trump carried the state handily in 2016 and 2020. Election officials reported results efficiently, enabling networks to call these races on election night. Mr. DeSantis himself declared that the state sets 'the gold standard' in election administration. 'He nevertheless wants state lawmakers to pony up $6 million to hire 52 people for his election police squad---which, naturally, would be under the governor's control and would investigate allegations of election crimes submitted by 'government officials or any other person. 'This would chill legitimate election work. In this, Mr. DeSantis's proposal would be similar to an anti-voting law Texas lawmakers passed recently, which would threaten election workers with criminal penalties for transgressions as mild as proactively offering voters mail-in ballot applications. In both cases, the effect is to intimidate people into thinking twice about doing anything they fear state authorities might construe as illegal. The system as it stands has kept fraud vanishingly rare in the United States. Proposals such as Mr. DeSantis's would only work to poison America's democracy.\n\nThe authoritarian impulse has been a hallmark of DeSantis's tenure since the beginning. Last April, he signed an 'anti-rioting' law that was one of the most sweeping attacks on the right to protest in memory. Among other things, it offers civil liability protection to those who mow down protesters with their cars, and would allow peaceful protesters to be charged with a felony if other people at a protest they attended committed an act of violence. 'Last week Raul Pino, the director of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County, was 'placed on administrative leave, and the Florida Department of Health is conducting an inquiry to determine if any laws were broken in this case.  Because he encouraged public health workers to be vaccinated. Pino didn't impose a mandate on anyone. His email was asking, pleading, begging people to get vaccinated---not requiring them to do so. 'DeSantis has called Florida 'the freest state in these United States'. Unless, that is, the freedom you're interested in involves encouraging people to get vaccinated, protecting your employees and customers from a pandemic, teaching history honestly, voting, protesting or anything else Republicans might not want you to do.\n\nWe're 10 months away from the midterm elections. Desperate for a contestany contestmost media outlets find DeSantis's growing profile delectable. 'And yet the nature of the feud itself says a great deal about how much the politics of Covid-19 have shifted in the year since Trump left office. Trump has, over the past year, beenat least by the dismal standards of the righta hype man for vaccines. DeSantis, meanwhile, has recently embraced vaccine skepticism and refused to disclose his own status. The result is. a rare instance in which Trump is 'out-of-step with the hardline elements of his party's base.  It also points to the growing potency of vaccine hesitancy on the right, as well as a potential fault line in upcoming elections in 2022 and 2024."

        "document": "Pelosi has for the most part been a highly effective House caucus leader, from whom Republicans could learn important lessons about ruthlessness, party discipline, and how to set priorities. One of the most striking features of Pelosi's tenure has been her ability, time and time again, to get moderate members of her caucus to vote for things that cost them their jobs (Obamacare being the most famous example).\n\nHouse Democrats throughout her tenure have played to maximize the success of the team: When out of power, they relax their ideological litmus tests in order to elect moderate-sounding people in swing districts, and when in power, they get those people to vote for progressive policy priorities knowing full well that this is not what their constituents want. But it's what Nancy Pelosi wanted. That's political hardball. It's why Pelosi became speaker twice, why she got things done for two Democratic presidents in the role, and why she has twice now found herself losing the majority.\n\nAs liberal as Pelosi's record was. she also had a pragmatic streak and attempted to walk the more radical elements of her party back from the ledge. During the Bush era, she fought back efforts by progressives to 'defund' the Iraq War, fearing that it would backfire by making Democrats come off as anti-troop. During the Obamacare fight, she helped persuade progressives to vote for a final version of the bill that did not include a public option.\n\nNancy Pelosi is a liberal who advanced liberal policies, but relatively speaking, she was also more pragmatic than the younger, more extreme elements within the party. Though we don't mourn her stepping down, without her at the helm, Democrats may have even fewer guardrails to prevent the party's continued leftward drift.\n\nTraditionally, defeated Speakers usually leave Congress, but Pelosi herself had already been an exception to that rule. She lost the gavel in the 2010 midterms, and failed to regain it in three subsequent national elections, including the one in which Barack Obama narrowly won re-election to the presidency. She regained it in the 2018 midterms, but then managed to be the first Speaker in long memory to lose seats while her party elected a new president. As Speaker, Pelosi will go out with a won-loss record in elections of 4-6.\n\nThat's not exactly a great record for an 'emeritus' standing. However, Pelosi raises tons of money for other House Democrats, and if she assumes that role, she likely will continue to control campaign cash, or at least influence its direction. A diplomatic post in Rome might be a great lark, but it will end Pelosi's ability to control outcomes in the House."

        "document": "There is only one issue in front of American voters. That issue is not about past votes in the Senate, who supported the war in Iraq, or how to unite the Democratic party. It's about how to survive the health and financial disaster that lies ahead. Sanders did a fine job of pinning Biden down on his past readiness to include social security in budget debates, and on his lack of details about how he would address the climate crisis. But scoring points doesn't count for much when the economy is in freefall and America's cities are shutting down to slow the pandemic's spread.\n\nBiden was about as sharp as he's been throughout the entire primary. He projected confidence and competence on the coronavirus pandemic, arguably beating Bernie on points when it came to Medicare-for-all's relevance to the crisis. He got in some solid hits on Sanders's record, particularly on guns and immigration, and offered up one of the night's most memorable lines about the primary during an exchange on campaign finance: 'I didn't have any money and I still won'. This should quiet at least some of worrying about whether he can withstand the rigors of a campaign and the presidency.\n\nBiden is very much a politician's politician (even Bernie Sanders likes him) and his restorationist, pro-system attitude reflects more than simple nostalgia. The former vice president, after all, acknowledges that there are real problems with the status quo. His complaint with Medicare-for-all is the practical politician's complaint---it's a nonstarter. Sanders has never produced a detailed financing plan or theory of exactly how his vision for single-payer should work. His team thinks organizing is prior to wonkery, and the point is to lay down a principle. 'By contrast Biden says he has a health care plan focused on an expansion with a public option that could really pass if Democrats win in 2020, thus helping people with their health care problems. He never actually says his proposal represents some kind of moral ideal. Indeed, it's not at all clear what Biden thinks an ideal health care system would look like. It's simply not the kind of question that interests him. Biden is doing politics. Bernie has been a politician a long time (and quietly knows how to do it pretty well) but fundamentally has the persona of a prophet. Democrats' choice is clearer than ever: Fight Trump or fight for revolution.\n\nBiden tried to extend olive branches to Sanders and his supporters Sunday night -- though his rival wasn't ready to bridge their ideological divides. The former vice president pointed to his moves within the previous two days to embrace free public university tuition for those whose families make less than $125, 000 per year and to embrace Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposal to undo much of a bankruptcy bill they'd fought over 15 years earlier. 'I agree with Bernie,  Biden said as they discussed surging help to hospitals facing the coronavirus pandemic. 'I agreed with Bernie,  he said later when noting they both believed those on Wall Street responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should have gone to jail.\n\nA word of advice to Joe Biden after Sunday night's debate: Call AOC. The politician who has shown the most lucid understanding of the importance of Democratic unity in the face of Donald Trump is Sanders' most obvious successor: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has urged the Democratic establishment to begin a conversation with younger Democrats. Rather than dwell on Sanders' likely defeat, she has already set her sights on obtaining concessions from Biden. 'Only 5 percent of young Latinos voted for Biden in California. The national picture is just as worrisome. As a proficient Spanish speaker who relates directly to the issues that have made progressive politics so relevant within the Latino community, Ocasio-Cortez could quickly upend that narrative. Granted, there isn't much competition, but no Hispanic politician can match her charisma. if she manages to navigate the tightrope between the Democratic party's progressive and moderate wings, Ocasio-Cortez could become Joe Biden's most important ally, a future presidential contender in her own right and Bernie Sanders' rightful heir as the voice of the progressive movement."

After Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza's second poisoning, in 2017, his wife traveled to Washington, where, with the support of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz. ), she provided samples of her husband's blood to the FBI for analysis. 'They did test them. And then they classified the results,  he said. 'He sued under the Freedom of Information Act and received several hundred pages of highly redacted documents. The papers show that the U. S. intelligence community thinks he was a victim of deliberate poisoning, but officials withheld the proof---the actual test results. 'Kara-Murza said he thinks that the Trump administration cut a deal with Russian security service chiefs during a meeting in Washington in which they agreed not to make the test results public. If Biden wants to send a signal to Moscow that he's taking a tougher line, there's a simple way to do it: Declassify Kara-Murza's test results.\n\nIt's worth remembering that the Obama administration's obsession with a Vladimir Putin 'reset' was a Joe Biden production. It was the reset that prompted the administration to remove a missile-defense system from Eastern Europe and worked to kill the Magnitsky Act---the sanctions bill named after Sergei Magnitsky, a whistleblower who was murdered by the Russian government. 'It was Biden who told Dmitry Medvedev, the lackey half of the Putin tandemocracy, that Russia's accession to the WTO was 'the most important item on our agenda.  A weird thing to gift a soulless dictator, I'd say. It was Biden who, one year before mocking Mitt Romney for his aggressive stance on Russia and accusing him of being a would-be slaveowner, praised Putin's stooge as 'one of the most powerful men in the world, and that's how we still think of you---I mean that sincerely. \n\nPutin's gangsterism has been ignored by administrations of both parties, starting with George W. Bush and most definitely including the Barack Obama/Biden terms. Almost literally the first thing Biden did in office was to extend an arms agreement with Putin despite US suspicions and evidence of Russian cheating on such treaties. Biden calls it a demonstration that we can 'walk and chew gum at the same time for places where it's in our mutual interest to to work together.  Putin likely sees it as more reason for impunity. 'Russia wasn't the only country that had been found to attempt interference in this election. The same intel report also found that Iran staged intel-propaganda operations to undercut Donald Trump. Will Iran also pay a price, or does Biden only plan payback for those who tried to make him look bad? So far, the administration keeps talking about how it wants to re-engage with Iran, not make them 'pay a price'. and Iran's mullahcracy has at least as much blood on their hands as Putin, much of it American blood. 'Ed Morrissey, Hot AirIn response to Biden's comments, 'Putin said 'I want to invite President Biden to continue our discussions, but on the condition that we do this actually live, online, but without any delay, but right in an open, direct discussion. He evidently believes the American president would slip up in any live interaction. former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told RIA Novosti that he had previously met 'Joe Biden at various international events. He gave the impression of being reasonable then. But apparently time hasn't been kind to him. 'Expect more Russian agitation toward the questioning of Biden's mental health. It's a preferable strategy for the Kremlin in three specific ways. First, it allows for a personal riposte to Biden's attack on Putin's character. 'Second, it plays to concerns in other governments that Biden is, perhaps, not as sharp as he once was. That is relevant in terms of the trust and confidence foundation, which ultimately underpins the U. S. -led liberal international order. Third, it offers a nice accoutrement to Putin's narrative that America is an archaic, weak, and corrupt nation built on shaky foundations."

Leading hawks in Washington, including key figures within the administration, see things much differently. senior administration officials are jetting around the Middle East in a bid to assuage allies that the White House is still committed to their security interests.

Yes, sure, fine, you can find nutty conspiracy theories, personal attacks, and unhinged demonization of Fauci, just as you can find that phenomenon of just about any public figure who has been venerated to the point of prayer candle merchandising. But has it ever crossed the minds of the team at Politico that maybe, just maybe, Fauci has earned some fair criticism? . 'Is it even remotely conceivable that significant swaths of the public are starting to get the sense that Fauci has been shading the truth and tweaking and tailoring his advice, sometimes in the face of well-reasoned opposition, for a long while now? Nothing Fauci's done earned him some criticism? Not even his reversal on masks? Nothing in his emails, suggesting a symbiotic relationship with adoring reporters? Nothing in his evasive answers about whether U. S. taxpayer money ended up financing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology? Nothing in Fauci's past defenses of gain-of-function research?\n\nAnthony Fauci's email correspondence from the early days of the pandemic have ignited a spate of recriminations over masks and the doctor's celebrity. But what really matters is that some of the emails raise more questions about the origin of Covid-19. 'From 2014-19, the National Institutes of Health sent $3. 4 million to the WIV Wuhan Institute of Virology through the nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance. The NIH money was spent on researching bat coronaviruses, and it's likely the WIV conducted gain-of-function research to make them more deadly or infectious. 'Dr. Fauci has said his outfit didn't fund gain-of-function research; the EcoHealth Alliance funding was meant to go to collecting samples. But 'I can't guarantee everything that's going on in the Wuhan lab, we can't do that,  Dr. Fauci said Wednesday in an interview with NewsNation Now. Dr. Fauci also said this week that his emails 'are really ripe to be taken out of context' and that 'you don't really have the full context.  That may be true. But it's all the more reason to investigate the U. S. links to WIV and gain-of-function research. The issue relates to Covid's origins but also to the future risks and benefits of such research.\n\nMost of Fauci's biggest whoppers didn't need to be exposed in his email correspondence. In fact, he openly admitted to lying to the American people on multiple occasions. He told the New York Times that he moved the goal posts on herd immunity because of 'his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks'. It wasn't the only noble lie. 'When Sen. Rand Paul suggested the fully-vaccinated Fauci was only wearing a mask as a matter of theater, the doctor vehemently denied the claim. But a few weeks later Fauci told Good Morning America that he had kept wearing a mask because he 'didn't want to look like I was giving mixed signals'. It was all an act, none of it based on science---all of it based on optics.\n\nFauci deceived the public about whether masks were necessary early on to preserve the existing supply for hospitals and he deceived the public again later by deliberately lowballing the threshold of herd immunity we'd need to contain the virus. That wasn't 'science.  That was government disinformation from a bureaucrat who hoped to engineer a particular policy outcome. 'It's true that in some cases his views have changed as data on COVID has developed. For instance, Fauci supported reopening schools many months ago as it became clearer that children didn't do much to spread the virus. Some of his 'reversals' are good-faith changes of heart in response to new studies. But not all are, and enough attention has been paid to those cases by now that you'd think he'd be more modest in trumpeting the alleged innocence of his approach."

At one point, nearing the climax, 'Barbie' stops cold so a Mattel doll designer (America Ferrera) with depressive inclinations can deliver a long monologue on how miserable it is to be female. For instance, she feels pressured to have lots of money but also pressured to not appear to seek it.\n\nTry to imagine 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' as written by someone who not only hated Mario and Luigi but blamed them for highway fatalities, climate change and gorilla abuse while tossing in some Proust references. Don't we go to a movie like 'Barbie' to escape the harrumphing tone of the most aggrieved Twitter users?\n\nFrom its opening moments, Barbie is intent on telling viewers that it is about feminism, and it takes itself seriously (but not too seriously). We're told, repeatedly over the course of two hours, that being a woman is hard. But beyond a final grasp at choice feminism---women should be whatever they want to be, whether that means a mother or an astronaut or both! ---viewers are not offered much of a path forward. As for any idea of what's good about being a woman, forget about it.\n\nBarbie echoes a shallow view of womanhood often perpetuated by transgender ideologues, who fetishize the trials of femaleness (periods, catcalls, sexism in general) while imagining the beauty of womanhood as no more than a doll's costume to put on or off. In Barbie's view, being a woman is tough, fraught with double standards (something we're sure men never have to face), and there's really not much good we can say about it. But at least there's a lot of pink.\n\nSome argue, 'Barbie is an undisciplined, goofy film for women (primarily) to gather for in posses, dress up, and revel in spectacle and recollection. It's two hours of beautiful people wearing gorgeous outfits that observers can recall owning and playing with on linoleum or shag carpeting. Like Saturday-morning cartoons, the movie is a pallet of marketing that just so happens to be good, and, as such, it is palatable consumerism in motion.\n\nThe politics of the movie are similarly inhuman and absurd---this is the rendering of a world supposed by children, with all the logical errancy that kids produce when all they know of life is from patching together mental woodcuts from whatever Mom and Dad divulge. That Barbie's Ken thinks men run the world by telling everyone what to do is correct---it is precisely what a little girl would imagine employment must be like after observing her mom coming home and routinely grousing about her jerk boss Kent. Grab some lifelong friends and delight in a juggernaut of capitalism. not everything has to be a battleground."
