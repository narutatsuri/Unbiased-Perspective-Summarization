        "document": "LGBTQ+ families, including mine, have been dusting off our living wills and seeking legal advice to ensure we are as protected as we can possibly be in the event that our marriages are dissolved. Will we need to carry our adoption papers when we go to the grocery store? Our living wills when we go to see the Grand Canyon? Will we have to go back to filing separate state and federal taxes, forced by the legal system to deny the existence of our relationship in order to complete our required paperwork?\n\nWhat's more, how will our child be treated as the kid of two moms in a country that is dismantling the careful framework we've built to support the changing landscape and dynamics of what it means to love, to grow a family, to support one another? Will our family be turned away, torn apart, bullied or worse? If those in charge are allowed to pick on us, to treat us as less than, what message does that send to my child's classmates? My bosses? To strangers we pass on the street? What might a future look like where our family is no longer recognized?\n\nCongress exercises its constitutional authority to command nationwide uniformity under the full faith and credit clause. So, for instance, Congress has ordered every state to grant full faith and credit to a custody determination and child support order issued by another state. It took this step to prevent parents from kidnapping their children by absconding to a different state and relitigating a custody order against them. The proposed law similarly appears to protect same-sex couples' parentage rights over their own children.\n\nMany states only acknowledge these rights because of Obergefell, which compelled them to give same-sex parents the same 'constellation of benefits' afforded to opposite-sex parents. So, for instance, a state must place both parents' names on their child's birth certificate and afford both parents the presumption of parentage; they cannot force one parent to 'adopt' a child conceived through assisted reproductive technology. Put simply, the RFMA creates a backstop to ensure that every same-sex couple can retain protections after Obergefell's demise if their own state nullifies their marriage.\n\nRight-wing commentators and politicians will say that Obergefell is 'settled law' and point to Justice Samuel Alito's reassurance that the court will not use the same logic they used in Dobbs to overturn Roe v. Wade as if everyone who supports marriage equality just fell off a catering truck full of gay wedding cakes. Please. Every justice on the court said that Roe was 'settled law' in their confirmation hearing and Alito's comment had Roberts and Kavanaugh, the two conservatives who pass for institutionalists, written all over it. It's obvious which way the wind is blowing and everyone knows it.\n\nThere might not be an immediate threat to Obergefell, but millions of LGBTQ Americans fear their hard-won right to marry whomever they love could at some point be taken away. This bill would relieve that uncertainty and enshrine their rights in the future. More than 70 percent say same-sex marriage should be recognized, according to a Gallup poll, up from 27 percent in 1996. This includes 55 percent of Republicans. Passing the Respect for Marriage Act would be politically popular. It would also be the moral, just thing to do."

        "document": "Biden scored a big win during the State of the Union when he appeared to get Republicans to agree not to cut funding for Medicare or Social Security. Republicans have since tried to make it seem as if they never intended to gut the entitlements programs, despite widespread evidence to the contrary. His new budget proposal will force Republicans to make their stance on Medicare funding clear for all to see.\n\nBiden folded this proposal into claims that Democrats have already vitally improved Medicare's solvency via the cost-containment measures in the Affordable Care Act and the power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare that was featured in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. By proposing to strengthen 'Medicare's newly established negotiation power,  Biden is now exposing and exploiting the GOP's extremely unpopular stance of solidarity with Big Pharma.\n\nAt the same time, he's countering Republicans' bad intent toward Medicare benefits with populist rhetoric about making the rich pay 'just a little bit more of their fair share'. When Medicare was passed, the wealthiest one percent of Americans didn't have more than five times the wealth of the bottom 50 percent combined, as is now the case, so it only makes sense that some adjustments be made to reflect that reality.\n\nSome mix of benefit reductions and tax increases is necessary. Think about raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67 to match the existing Social Security retirement age for those born in 1960 or later. Perhaps raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries with higher incomes. And maybe reduce Social Security benefits for those with higher incomes. Many of the Trump tax cuts expire in 2025. This could be leverage to negotiate tweaks to the payroll tax.\n\nWhat Republicans mostly talk about is raising the age cutoff for Social Security and Medicare. But while it's certainly true that people live longer than they used to, and remain in better health, the frame of reference for advocates of this idea is the professional class, to which most Americans don't belong. Less than 20 percent of all people aged 65 or older still work or seek work. Employers don't particularly want them.\n\nA better way to save Social Security? It's simple: Eliminate the regressive $160, 200 cap on payroll taxes. The Lakers pay LeBron James, the highest-paid NBA player in history, $44. 5 million. Why do we exempt $44. 3 million of that from the FICA tax? Were LeBron to protest that a 15 percent surtax on 100 percent of his income would be unreasonable, we could politely explain to him that that injustice is already visited on 94 percent of his fellow Americans. Eliminating the cap would more than cover the Social Security and Medicare shortfall."

        "document": "The chaos on the floor over the past week shows House Republicans aren't ready to govern and casts alarming doubt on whether Congress is capable of raising the debt ceiling to avoid a U. S. government default in coming months. Unless Mr. McCarthy is willing to rely on Democratic votes when the good of the country depends on it, we fear the House is going to be a scary place for the next two years.\n\nOne way out lies not with Mr. McCarthy but with individual members who get fed up with dysfunction. They can use more discharge petitions to force votes on bills that stand to attract majority support---if they could get onto the floor. With such a closely divided House, a handful of moderate Republicans could work with Democrats to circumvent the Rules Committee and GOP leadership to bring bipartisan measures to the floor.\n\nIn campaigning for the 2022 midterm elections, the G. O. P. rode a wave of extremism, saying little about the politics of hate and denial practiced by some of its candidates in an effort to capture votes. The party is now paying a price for its silence. Its members are grappling with the reality of working with people who loudly and proudly challenge political institutions and the democratic process.\n\nIn effect, we're witnessing the rupture of the Republican Party, the ultimate outcome of Republicans' continuing failure to stand up to the extremism in their ranks. It's encouraging to think that there are moderate Republicans who don't support this brand of politics. There are certainly many. But until they organize themselves and oppose their in-house opposition, they're pushing the nation ever closer to a dangerous edge.\n\nSome argue, 'Democratic socialists fight for universal health care, an end to the climate catastrophe and mass incarceration, and economic democracy. But if we're going to triumph over the forces of reaction and win these changes and more, we're going to need to learn to fight harder and smarter. In the last week, the Republican right fought Kevin McCarthy's bid to become Speaker of the House and showed everyone how to play political hardball to build power.\n\nAs the minority in Democratic caucuses in DC and in state legislatures like New York, the Left needs to think creatively about how to best strengthen our position. The Right showed the way here. Not in the demands it made---most of those are specific to its own agenda of taking an ax to the federal government---but in how it made them. To achieve very different ends, we should be prepared to go to war against Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and others who otherwise have no sympathy for or interest in advancing our agenda."

        "document": "Critics like to point to human land-use practices as the cause. But they cannot explain the devastating infernos of the past decadethese would not be possible without human-driven climate change. Last year's National Climate Assessment made clear that climate change played a greater role in the observed increasing extent of these wildfires than land management or fire suppression efforts. 'In the Western US, climate change has increased the risk of fire weather fivefold and has doubled how much land has burned. Wildfire frequency has quadrupled since the 1980s, and fire season has lengthened by more than two months (78 days). While any number of factors (lightning, a discarded cigarette, a campfire, or faulty power line) may ignite a fire, it's the underlying environment that matters once a fire starts. Without solving the problem at its source, the fires will only continue to rage bigger and spread further.\n\nA kind of toxic debt is embedded in much of the infrastructure that America built during the 20th century. For decades, corporate executives, as well as city, county, state, and federal officials, not to mention voters, have decided against doing the routine maintenance and deeper upgrades to ensure that electrical systems, roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure can function properly under a range of conditions. Kicking the can down the road like this is often seen as the profit-maximizing or politically expedient option. But it's really borrowing against the future, without putting that debt on the books. 'Climate change is calling in the debt on America's infrastructure. The blackouts are already costing Californians billions of dollars. The status quo has been revealed to be expensive, as it will be elsewhere. When the true costs are calculated, more radical solutions will start to seem practical, even obviouswhich is good, because we need them.\n\nIt is the 21st century now, the century of the climate change crisis, and the giant machine that was built to distribute electricity---a system of exposed overhead power lines that travel hundreds of miles over land---is more and more vulnerable to the rise in extreme weather. The imperative now is to reduce dependence on that increasingly brittle system, to strengthen the resilience and independence of local communities by enabling them to generate, store, and manage more of their own power. 'Good distribution-level planning will create microgrids within microgrids, each able to island from the level above, so that the system is more modular and less vulnerable to single points of failure. It will tie together solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electric vehicle chargers with smart controls and software. It will bring economic development, jobs, and innovation to local communities. And a bottom-up energy system will complement and ease the pressure on California's increasingly shaky and vulnerable top-down system. 'But it is only possible if utilities become partners in the effort. That will require fundamental change in the regulatory structure now governing PG&E, to bring its financial interests in sync with the social, environmental, and economic interests of California communities.\n\nIs PG&E too big? Probably. Is there not enough money? Definitely. Is there a massive failure of operations? Obviously. Are more people dying every year and losing everything they have? Yes. Newsom has expressed interest in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway making a bid for PG&E. Right now, it's hard to imagine anyone doing a worse job of running PG&E than PG&E has done. It probably makes sense to put the company under some kind of new management. 'But that won't fix the fact that policies that are supposed to govern the entity haven't worked. And it potentially could keep the decision-making of how to clean up this mess off the governor's desk. PG&E may be a villain to Californians in this case, but for leaders who don't want to be responsible for blackouts affecting millions, they're also a convenient one.\n\nSome critics note that 'If we redesigned our cities for the modern world, they'd be taller and less stretched out into the fire-prone far reaches---what scientists call the wildland-urban interface. Housing would be affordable because there'd be more of it. You'd be able to get around more cheaply because we'd ditch cars and turn to buses and trains and other ways we know how to move around a lot of people at high speeds, for low prices. 'But the big things still seem impossible here. In a state where 40 years ago, homeowners passed a constitutional amendment enshrining their demands for low property taxes forever, where every initiative at increasing density still seems to fail, where vital resources like electricity are managed by unscrupulous corporations and where cars are still far and away the most beloved way to get around, it's hard to imagine systemic change happening anytime soon. And so we muddle on toward the end. All the leaves are burned and the sky is gray. California, as it's currently designed, will not survive the coming climate. Either we alter how we live here, or many of us won't live here anymore."

S. senator should be indicted. He was a Democrat. I also approved the prosecution of another sitting senator. He was a Republican. Those matters came up through the bureaucracy because they were highly visible and politically controversial. 'The decisions of the dedicated professionals who are the heart and soul of the department merit respect and a substantial degree of deference. But those decisions must also be subject to review. The higher the profile of a case, the more deserving it is of high-level attention, because the public will measure the department by its actions in such matters. Barr wasn't intervening inappropriately. He was doing his job. A more risk-averse attorney general might have let the recommendation stand and avoided a political hot potato. The American people might want to think twice before concluding that is the kind of attorney general the Justice Department should have.\n\nRoger Stone has been sentenced to 40 months by U. S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson. I previously stated that the likely sentence would be half of what the prosecutors originally sought and that is precisely what the court did. The sentence not only completed the conviction of Roger Stone but completely vindicated Attorney Bill Barr on the appropriate length of the sentence. 'While Judge Jackson stood up for the original prosecutors and called the sentencing change 'unprecedented,  she notably followed the Barr's call for sentencing below half of what the original prosecutors requested. I have been in cases. where prosecutors have sought excessive sentences but that does not make it acceptable or right. Given the overwhelming view that the original recommendation was wrong, I find it hard to understand why Main Justice should have stayed silent and not informed the court that justice would not be served with such a sentence.\n\nDOJ recommended 7 to 9 years. Trump tweeted. Barr defended DOJ's case but said that was too high. DOJ suggested 3 to 4 years. Barr told Trump to stop tweeting. Huge campaign to get Barr to resign. Obama-appointed judge sentenced Stone to just over 3 years.\n\nIf Barr were truly Trump's henchman, he would have squashed the Stone case rather than merely recommending a little less jail time at the end. Barr allowed the Mueller probe to reach its conclusion unmolested. The extent of his alleged interference was, prior to the release of the report, summarizing its findings in a way that wasn't harsh or detailed enough for Trump's critics. Finally, he declined to prosecute former Department of Justice official and frequent Trump target Andrew McCabe for lying to investigators. If Barr were really Trump's Roy Cohn, his personal enforcer masquerading as a top law-enforcement official, nailing McCabe would have been his Job One.\n\nThere is substantial new evidence that the foreperson of the jury that convicted Stone has a 'history of Democratic activism and a string of anti-Trump, left-wing social media posts.  Before she was ever picked as a juror, Tomeka Hart posted comments about the Stone case and mocked those who argued that his arrest was an example of excessive force. She praised the Mueller investigation and suggested that Trump and his supporters were racists. Trump was right when he called the Stone prosecution 'a miscarriage of justice.  That is a tweet to which Barr should pay attention."

        "document": "Democrats for years have treated PG&E as their de facto political subsidiary. The wildfires and blackouts are the direct result of their mismanagement. For instance, the Legislature in 2015 mandated that utilities spend $100 million annually on solar systems in low-income communities. This is on top of the $2. 2 billion in customer rebates for rooftop solar installations. 'Last year PG&E invested more than $150 million in battery storage and 'sustainable' technologies, which was paid for by a special charge on ratepayers. PG&E is also spending $130 million over three years to install 7, 500 electric-car charging stations and offers drivers a $800 'clean fuel' rebate. All of this has been part of a Democratic political strategy to use PG&E to advance their climate agenda without raising taxes. But Californians have instead paid through higher electric ratesPG&E rates are twice as high as in Oregon and Washington.\n\nThe same California that has boldly committed to transitioning to 50 percent renewable energy by 2025---and 100 percent renewable energy by 2045---can't manage its existing energy infrastructure. The same California that has pushed its electricity rates to the highest in the contiguous United States through its mandates and regulations doesn't provide continuous access to that overpriced electricity. 'The state could have, if it wanted, pushed the utilities to focus on the resilience and safety of its current infrastructure---implicated in some of the state's most fearsome recent fires---as a top priority. Instead, the commission forced costly renewable-energy initiatives on the utilities. In 2016, then-governor Jerry Brown actually vetoed a bill that had unanimously passed the state legislature to promote the clearing of trees dangerously close to power lines. Brown's team says this legislation was no big deal, but one progressive watchdog called the bill 'neither insignificant or small. \n\nBetween the drought and the bugs, millions of trees diedtrees that had to be left in place because regulators, environmentalists, and politicians couldn't muster the will to permit harvesting or clearing before they became worthless and deadly matchsticks. In 2012, the Forest Service estimated that 77 million acres, mostly in the West, was at risk due to insects and disease. 'Meanwhile, PG&E is struggling to find the qualified crews to do the dangerous work of clearing trees from almost 2, 500 miles of powerlines across the vast northern reaches of the state. That isn't surprising, given that California and federal regulators armed with anti-logging policies put most of those people in the unemployment line, and they've moved on to other jobs or even states. 'Chuck DeVore, The Federalist\n\nBecause California accounts for less than 1% of global emissions, nothing it does will make a difference to climate, but its ratepayers shell out billions for wind and solar that might be better spent on fireproofing. A generation of ill-judged environmental activism has all but ended forest management in favor of letting dead trees and underbrush build up because it's more 'natural'. An activist state Supreme Court imposed on utilities responsibility for any wildfires started by their equipment regardless of negligence. At the same time, state policy obliges them to extend their networks to support housing developments in areas the state designates as 'very high fire risk'. 'Entrenched one-party government has given California's political class too much incentive to cater to the perpetual, year-round, full-time priorities of public-sector unions, green groups and the organized academic left rather than care about the quality of life for the average person in the state.\n\nCould climate change be the reason for excessive winds and dry weather? Of course. But. it matters little that the governor is'committed to addressing climate change' when he's not committed to preventing forest fires. California is dry. Not from climate change but from poor water management. Earlier this year the Sierra Nevada snowpack was 202 percent above the average (probably caused by climate change) with ski slopes operating into July. Where did the melt go? It is diverted, and California's waterways do not run naturally. So much so that a proposal was introduced in 2010 to allow at least 60 percent of the rivers to flow unencumbered. Last year that was reduced to 40 percent, and the policy has still not been implemented. California doesn't lack water; it lacks flowing water.\n\nSome posit that 'The technological answer to the risk from exposed power lines is the power lines should instead be buried beneath the surface. We are fully capable of providing an electricity grid year-round without burning down half the countryside. Other places in other countries manage it without problems. It is, though, more expensive. PG&E has asked for permission to charge higher rates so that it can clear the paths of those lines, replace old posts, and generally maintain the system better. They've also been told, so far at least, that they can't have them. California will keep burning until we accept higher prices for electricity."

By all accounts, including South Africa's, Israel has the undeniable military capability to completely destroy the entire Gaza Strip in a matter of minutes if it so desired. Noticeably, Israel has not done so, and instead has taken extreme measures to protect Gazan civilians.\n\nThe entire context of Israel's military response is completely, indefensibly, ignored; nowhere does the application even consider the possibility that Israel's actions are lawful under the doctrines of, say, military necessity, proportionality, force protection, or deterrence in responding to a terrorist organization. Yes, blockades and sieges could be war crimes---but they aren't in this case; both the Geneva and Hague Conventions include instructions on conducting sieges under international law, and Israel has followed those rules to the letter.\n\nIn recent decades, as many as three million people perished in a famine in North Korea that was mainly government-induced. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians were gassed, bombed, starved or tortured to death by the Assad regime, and an estimated 14 million were forced to flee their homes. China has put more than a million Uyghurs through gulag-like re-education camps.\n\nBut North Korea, Syria and China have never been charged with genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel has. The war between Israel and Hamas is terrible---as is every war. But if this is genocide, what word do we have for the killing fields in Cambodia, Stalin's Holodomor in Ukraine, the Holocaust itself?\n\nIf Israel were trying to commit genocide, it wouldn't be putting its soldiers at risk or allowing humanitarian relief to arrive from Egypt or withdrawing many of its forces from Gaza. It would simply be killing Palestinians everywhere, in vastly greater numbers, as Germans killed Jews or Hutus killed Tutsis.\n\nBut arguing the merits presumes this case is more than political theater. South Africa sees U.N. grandstanding as a way to curry favor with Russia, China and Iran, which are eager to reduce Western influence. Where was South Africa's moral outrage when the country tolerated Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe, or when it opposed the indictment of Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir for killing some 200, 000 people in Darfur?\n\nIf the U.N. wants to find genocidal intent, try the Hamas charter. The preamble says 'Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.  It encourages Muslims to 'fight Jews and kill them' until the Jews 'hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.

Kennedy was obviously in the midst of his official duties when he kneeled on the field, in uniform, responsible for the conduct of his students. And when he led his prayer circles, he was not 'quiet,  but loud and prominent by design. His expression was a quintessential example of on-the-job 'government speech' that, according to Garcetti, falls outside the First Amendment.\n\nTo reach his conclusion, Gorsuch simply rewrote the facts. In his account, Kennedy had been suspended exclusively for his silent prayernot the spectacle he created by hijacking football games with prayer circles. And because this prayer was allegedly so 'quiet,  it qualified as 'private' expression shielded by the First Amendment.\n\nThe coach's prayer, Gorsuch insisted, was 'not delivered as an address to the team, but instead in his capacity as a private citizen.  So even though he was in the middle of a field that he could only access because he was performing his job responsibilities, his speech bore no imprint of government approval, and was totally unconnected to his work as a coach.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, writing the majority opinion, declared: 'Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse Republic---whether those expressions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether they manifest through the spoken word or a bowed head.\n\nIn doing so, Sotomayor wrote, the court 'elevates one individual's interest in personal religious exercise, in the exact time and place of that individual's choosing, over society's interest in protecting the separation between church and state, eroding the protections for religious liberty for all. \n\nThere is a greater issue that the majority, in their zeal, chose to ignore: the freedom of the students to not pray. I'm sure they would say that this freedom remains, and no one has to pray if they choose not to. But such a perspective is risible. Anyone who has ever played high school sports knows that if your coach is doing something, particularly something religious, and expects you to join, then you had better do it. To stand out and say, 'I am Jewish' or 'I am Muslim' or 'I am an atheist'or even simply 'I don't want to do that'is to be labeled a distraction, a locker-room cancer, or worse.\n\nIt's not just about limiting your time on the field. It's also about making you an outcast among your teammates, a prospect in your teen years about as painful and harmful as not being able to play a sport you love.

The budget cuts in this deal would likely go into effect down the road, which means there's a chance a future Congress will overturn them down the line. The deal still has to be passed by the House and Senate, and signed by Trump. But by striking such a deal, congressional leaders and the Trump administration are averting a disaster scenario.\n\nDiscretionary spending has been declining steadily for four decades, interrupted only by the Iraq War and the Great Recession. The new budget deal will keep it at about 6 percent of GDP, the same as it was in 2000 and far less than it was in 1980. This is hardly a picture of a budget that's skyrocketing out of control. If the hawks want to gripe about mandatory spendingprimarily Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other social welfare programsthat's fine. Gripe away. But today's budget deal has nothing to do with that.\n\nMany argue, 'It's official: Conservatives only care about deficits when a Democrat is president. Everyone in Washington seems to suddenly accept the economic and political benefits of government spending, as the GOP hopes to keep the stock market goosed past Trump's reelection. While it's great that Washington appears to have avoided another truly stupid, self-inflicted government shutdown, Congress is whistling past the graveyard. That's because deficits are growing while the economy is booming---up 23% in the first nine months of the fiscal year alone. That's not supposed to happen. And there will be hell to pay when the remorseless math of rapidly falling tax revenue kicks in during the next downturn.\n\nIt's often overlooked, but the biggest economic improvement since Trump took office is more government spending.\n\nI don't doubt that many House members elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 truly thought they were helping the economy by trying to bring federal spending down. But Congressional Republicans' overall loss of interest in deficit reduction after Trump's inauguration does seem to indicate that partisan calculations were paramount. House Democrats, meanwhile, have far less ideological reason to oppose increases in government spending. But their unwillingness since taking charge in January to play hardball on legislation that might endanger the ongoing expansion also seems to bespeak a different attitude toward partisanship and macroeconomic policy. House Republicans were willing to hold the U. S. economy hostage for partisan advantage. House Democrats have not been.\n\nMany progressives seem to want Democrats to learn from the scorched-earth tactics of Republicans. But Republicans would be wiser to learn from the bargaining strategy of Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Except for a brief shutdown in January 2018 over immigration that was quickly, and wisely, abandoned, congressional Democrats haven't tried to take the government hostage during the Trump administration. (The only protracted shutdown of the Trump presidency was instigated by Trump, effectively taking his own government hostage in order to win border wall money. It didn't work. ) Instead, Democratic leaders have negotiated budget agreements with Republicans in good faith, and they have won policy victories in the process.\n\nRegarding the debt ceiling, 'rather than treating it as a matter of good housekeeping, politicians have fallen into the habit of flirting with default, engaging in bouts of brinkmanship that culminate in ad hoc deals on borrowing and spending. Congress seems unable to perform its duties unless it is acting under the threat of crisis. This is not a good way to run a government.\n\nIn 2011, debt-rating agency Standard & Poors decided the U. S. no longer deserved the firm's highest credit score, mostly because of the federal government's refusal to free the Treasury's borrowing authority from political gamesmanship. The Government Accountability Office said in 2012 that the delays in raising the debt ceiling in 2011 cost the government $1. 3 billion in higher interest payments that year. if political leaders want to prioritize fiscal responsibility, they shouldn't need a legal mechanism to do so; they should simply act accordingly."

Proportionally, Israel's campaign has exceeded the destruction of the Allied bombings of Germany in World War II.\n\nU. S. intelligence estimated that 40 to 45 percent of the 29, 000 bombs Israel had dropped were unguided, prone to cause greater collateral damage. Indeed, an Israeli rear admiral acknowledged before the ground invasion began that while the Israel Defense Forces was 'balancing accuracy. right now, we're focused on what causes maximum damage. Israel will one day have to ask itself whether it acted appropriately in the heat of its anger and sorrow after Oct. 7.\n\nThe words of Israeli officials are being offered as evidence of intent: from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging Israelis to 'remember' the Old Testament account of the carnage of Amalek ('Spare no one, but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings,  reads one passage) to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowing that 'Gaza won't return to what it was before---we will eliminate everything' to the minister of energy and infrastructure pledging, 'They will not receive a drop of water or a single battery until they leave this world.\n\nI have heard many people balk at the suggestion that Gaza could be experiencing genocide. The Holocaust, after all, wiped out over 60 percent of European Jews. Israel's war---instigated, no less, by the murder of Jews---has killed about 1 percent of the Palestinians in Gaza. One percent is terrible, of course, but genocide? Under the genocide convention, though, the term describes an intent to wipe out a defined group of people and taking steps to achieve that end. There is no threshold of death or proportion of death that must be reached.\n\nOthers argue, 'there is no evidence that Israeli forces have engaged in a deliberate campaign to 'destroy, in whole or in part,  the Palestinian people---which is what 'genocide' means in international law. Awful as the civilian deaths in Gaza have been, they still constitute less than 1 percent of the territory's population. If Israel, with all the firepower at its disposal, had been trying to commit mass murder, the death toll would have been higher by orders of magnitude.\n\nBut, however the case turns out, one thing is certain: It will do nothing to relieve the suffering of Palestinians. These incendiary accusations only serve, for many Israelis, to discredit more legitimate, more measured criticism of Israel's actions. They play into Netanyahu's 'us vs. the world' narrative in which the right-wing prime minister is the only person who can protect Israelis. Many of whom, no doubt, will wrongly conclude that self-restraint on the part of their forces is pointless if they are going to be accused of genocide no matter what they do."
